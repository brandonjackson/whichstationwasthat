Dying Child’s Life Saved by Radio.

The radio bedtime story is credited in Seattle (U.S.A.) with saving the life of a little listener, and as the story comes from a physician, it carries some weight. It was the doctor’s own five-year-old son whose life was saved when his father’s skill failed. Ever since he was two years old, young George Lawson had flattened his ears under headphones, scorning the loud-speaker. His father, Dr. G. G. Lawson, was a radio “fan” himself, but sometimes grew impatient when George Junior monopolised the ’phones. A few weeks ago George Junior went down with pneumonia. He weakened rapidly and nothing his father could do seemed to help. The child lost all interest in life. Seeking a way to revive his interest—his last chance—Dr. Lawson telephoned broadcasting station KOMO and told them the circumstances. Then, early in the evening, he slipped the headphones on the unconscious boy’s ears and waited. Down at KOMO a special programme for the dying youngster was broadcast. Up at the sick room no result was apparent until the boys in the studio broke into the child’s favourite song. Then he revived a little. Finally, they promised him a big surprise for the next evening. That did the trick. George Junior was so anxious to hear that “surprise” that he forgot to die; his interest in life came back. Each night, for a week, the broadcasters, ignoring everything else, worked to keep the spark of life alive in the boy’s breast. They won. George is back on his feet to-day—and his father says that the radio, not medical skill, saved his life.
