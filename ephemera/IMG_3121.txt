Distance—with the convenience of simplified control

MARCONIPHONE MODEL 51 (5-VALVE) RECEIVER

Simplicity of tuning, great sensitivity and possibility of operation directly from house electric supply, entirely without batteries or accumulators, are outstanding features of Marconiphone Model 51.

This 5-valve receiver employs two neutralised high frequency stages, a grid detector and two low frequency valves, tuning being reduced to single master control and two small verniers which only require slight adjustment after a station is heard. A particularly handsome mahogany cabinet with sloping sides encloses the components, and all chassis-so- balanced batteries or power-units can be supplied, producing a neat self-contained installation. With either A.C. or D.C. mains, the Model 51 brings all the advantages of battery-less radio into being—and where mains electricity is not available, economical battery combinations may be used.

Receiver only, with long and short wave coils; including royalty £27 2s. 6d.

The D.C. Mains Drive Unit for operating direct from the house electric supply costs £6 10s., or for A.C. mains, including valve (royalty), £9.
