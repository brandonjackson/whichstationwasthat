     Line: In the following article Capt. Eckersley discusses the subject of “distant listening.” He shows how his definition last week of the service area is not inconsistent with the policy of World-Radio—that, namely, of same “reaching out” to stations beyond the listener’s service area.

     Line: Of course, one of the most potent factors militating against the perfect reception of the ever so powerful distant station is “fading”; that is, the signal which for some time is strong, becomes in a few minutes weak (fades away, that is), and then builds up to great strength once more.

     Line: DX Work Through the Summer. Fading apart, signal strength has been generally very good indeed. I can see as yet no signs whatever of any marked waning, and I believe that the improved receiving sets of to-day, in conjunction with the higher power of many Continental stations, will enable DX work to be carried on uninterruptedly right through the summer. My own experience last summer was that I was able to log practically the same number of stations as during the darker months, but that in most cases signal strength was less. To my mind summer long-distance work is particularly interesting, for, though during the winter it is easy enough for almost anyone to bring in a considerable number of stations, summer conditions are the real test of the efficiency of the apparatus and of the skill of the operator.

     Line: I wonder if any reader picked up a strong transmission working on approximately 510 m. at 11.30 p.m. on April 21. The announcer was speaking German, but though I listened for some time no indication was given which enabled the station to be identified. Lyons Doua is now an excellent signal, but Paris PTT seems to have found a thoroughly bad spot. All that could be heard of him on several evenings was a weird jumbled noise, which suggested that somebody else was transmitting upon exactly the same wave. Bruenn has been coming in well in some places, though with me he has not been very strong. Fredriksstad has been good at times, as have both Bordeaux Lafayette and Bilbao (EAJ11), provided that only one of them was working at the time. Langenberg seems to vary his power considerably. At times he is a good signal and at others quite poor. Stuttgart is perhaps the strongest transmission on the medium waves just now, though he is run fairly close by Prague, San Sebastian, and Petit Parisien.

     Line: Turning to the first class of interference, that made by listeners themselves, it would seem foolish as a twice-told tale to rant against that oscillation spoils wireless. It is a pathetic fact that certain listeners cause interference themselves representing 50 per cent. of the total interferences complained about by listeners. No amount of publicity, appeal, or argument appears to convince people that in making their sets oscillate they not only ruin their own, but thousands of other people’s, pleasure. Lots of it comes about through ignorance, and that’s why we have a pamphlet, free, and it tells people what oscillation is, how to do it, and what not to do not to do it. Some of it comes about maliciously — I might almost say. I heard a distinguished foreign artist denounced one of our concerts, a splendid “die hard I” near me oscillated the whole evening. A curiously narrow and conceited outlook that his disapproval should be made unpleasantly manifest to thousands of others who might not think the same as almighty he. But enough about oscillation. One can only conclude, as always, with the hope that in time people will learn what it means and that some others will learn sense and decency.

     Line: In America, where reaching out has its greatest vogue, there is probably less oscillation than in Britain, where 10 per cent. of masts. I should say, concentrate upon their local station. This the old way of home making by amateurs has given way to purchase from manufacturers, and manufacturers in their turn have realised that oscillation kills the goose that lays the golden eggs. I do not mean by this to despise or to sneer at amateurs or home constructors. I should feel no slight if the designer of a famous camera discouraged me in a friendly way from trying to make one no better and even for less money than that which I could buy. I am no expert in all sorts of lines. I could not make a gramophone or a motor cycle, or a perambulator. Why, then, should I expect others to be able to make a satisfactory high-frequency radio set?

Such is the habitual and almost inevitable.

     Line: At the transmitting end the determination of the best time for relay was based upon transmitter conditions and the strength of the transmitting signals, much in the same manner as that which would normally be used at the receiving end of the relay scheme. Usually at the relay end the variations in strength due given, but changes at some other time, after about 8 p.m. G.M.T., were soon beginning to affect it and the relay reception, when suddenly interrupted during one of the tests, was less in comparison, and consequently the ratio is higher. Further, in this case they are extremely interesting, and are shown on 32, 29.

File A last line: I saw the hour hand on the dial of the Studio Clock creeping slowly towards the time for the next relay of the dance music. The boats rocked gently as the tide rose and fell; the sound of the wireless jazz penetrated far and wide into every part of the village. The tiny town seemed to have undergone a rapid transformation. The gentle ticking of the wireless Studio Clock suddenly took on an added significance in my mind. It seemed that something wonderful had happened in that half-hour of jazz. True, the boatmen and the organ-grinders had departed into the distance, but a new and original kind of entertainment had taken their place. It was a moment of satisfaction in the life of the village—a moment when a latter-day miracle had been performed and a new kind of happiness had been brought about by wireless.

But it must be remembered that there are ascending mains for gas and ascending means. Plumbers sometimes use for mains jointed lengths of pipes connected up by two water use and used, and in such cases the flow of small cracks in the mortar and inner surface and in masonry and no matters construction the water deposits may or may or may not be prevented and the earth path thereby therefore likely much to be desired.

Goldsmith (20, Fair Close Road, Beccles, Suffolk): Sir,—Just lately in the course of a few nights’ run over the stations between 187.5 and 2,650 metres, I have succeeded in listening to and identifying no less than 100. This seems a good proportion out of the list you give week by week, and as so many stations are on a common wave, and there is hopeless jamming at a number of other places, the total is, perhaps, not bad for a 3-valve set. It would certainly seem that, situated as we are here, about 10 miles from the east coast, we are not unfavourably placed for receiving Continental stations, allowing for the scourge of morse. Apart from 5XX, 5GB, and 2LO, the most satisfactory and dependable loud-speaker stations seem to me to be the Germans, which it is almost always a pleasure to listen to. Other stars of the firmament are, however: Malmo, Milan, Dublin, Prague (when not interfered with), Madrid (EAJ7), Toulouse (Rad. du Midi), Glasgow, Bruenn, Rome, Aberdeen, Brussels, Rosenhügel, Zürich (when it can be heard between the morse), Hilversum, Warsaw, Kalundborg, Motala, Moscow (RAI), Radio Paris, Kosice, and Eiffel Tower. The French stations, considering their generally small power, are often comparatively strong, and the same remark applies to the low-power Swedish relays late at night. The way in which some stations situated on a common wave sort themselves out above the noise is very interesting. If any of our German friends happen to be members of a happy little group of half-a-dozen stations on the same wave, one may be sure that they, at any rate, will not be the ones to take the wall. Cork, however, is a pushing young person; he sorts himself out from the six other stations on 400 metres, and although fading lamentably is quite of respectable volume at times.—Yours faithfully, October 9.

     Line: The radio bedtime story is credited in Seattle (U.S.A.) with saving the life of a little listener, and as the story comes from a physician, it carries some weight. It was the doctor’s own five-year-old son whose life was saved when his father’s skill failed. Ever since he was two years old, young George Lawson had flattened his ears under headphones, scorning the loud-speaker. His father, Dr. G. G. Lawson, was a radio “fan” himself, but sometimes grew impatient when George Junior monopolised the ’phones. A few weeks ago George Junior went down with pneumonia. He weakened rapidly and nothing his father could do seemed to help. The child lost all interest in life. Seeking a way to revive his interest—his last chance—Dr. Lawson telephoned broadcasting station KOMO and told them the circumstances. Then, early in the evening, he slipped the headphones on the unconscious boy’s ears and waited. Down at KOMO a special programme for the dying youngster was broadcast. Up at the sick room no result was apparent until the boys in the studio broke into the child’s favourite song. Then he revived a little. Finally, they promised him a big surprise for the next evening. That did the trick. George Junior was so anxious to hear that “surprise” that he forgot to die; his interest in life came back. Each night, for a week, the broadcasters, ignoring everything else, worked to keep the spark of life alive in the boy’s breast. They won. George is back on his feet to-day—and his father says that the radio, not medical skill, saved his life.

I am afraid that Radio-Paris, which seems a very lively station and 5XX will become more difficult to receive entirely clear of interruption from one or other of these stations. Motala seems to have fallen in strength of late, but is still a very strong signal. Königs wusterhausen has shown much fluctuation during the week, and though always within reach, is not so strong at any time as Motala. It is usual on the Continent to refer to these last two, with 5XX and Radio-Paris, as the “Big Four,” but I consider that this description requires modification, for the new Danish transmitter at Kalundborg is an excellent signal, and is always as strongly received as Hilversum, and without any fading whatever, either in daylight or darkness. I suppose that all listeners who “reach out” are fully aware that, for daylight programmes, the long-wave stations are always preferable to others on the 300-500 metre waveband, since signals are stronger and fading is scarcely noticeable. In this part of the country we are well placed for reception of the Continental programmes from the northern part of Europe, the North Sea being very little hindrance as compared with intervening land areas. Warsaw I have found to be rather variable of late, but Hilversum has been fairly reliable, though, as “The Searcher” last week reported, there has been some interference on the new long wave, and on 1,000 metres only fairly well, together

I have noticed this trouble on all the stations operating between, say, 1,000 and 2,000 metres, not excluding 5 XX, but I can say that, apart from that, R.5XX has had no fading as far as I can see, since it opened full time on Hurlingham, even though the “shelf” would suffer in the same way shortly afterwards, from conversational work transmitted thereon. I have even known the Hurlingham transmissions fade while 5XX was not so badly affected, so that the local fault, if it existed, was not to blame, and I can only conclude that this was due to the same causes, which had that temporary adverse effect.

It must also be remembered that, whereas London newspapers used to find a place for Saturday night wireless programmes, they are now cold on the subject and do not give the programmes, salary cuts having resulted in the wholesale sacking of wireless correspondents and the extent of detail in wireless programmes having been cut.

     Line: When the set is not calibrated, a similar process can be used. Suppose, for example, that you have never heard Göteborg, but do receive Frankfurt and Berne, you know that the Swedish station is to be found by careful searching between the settings needed for the other two. Note well that “careful searching” does NOT mean allowing the set to oscillate. No station received by this process can be regarded as fairly logged.

     Line: Where a grid-leak-and-condenser rectifier is used the selectivity may be increased by the use of a potentiometer. This component is wired directly across the low-tension leads and the grid-leak return, instead of being connected to low-tension positive, is taken to its slider. It will often be found that signal strength does not suffer, whilst selec- tivity shows a marked increase if the slider of the potentiometer is moved some little distance away from the positive end of its travel.

     Line: In relation to the position in Australia, it must be realised that broadcasting itself only began there in the latter months of 1923. Certain factors which have tended to check the progress have been the great distances, the relatively small population, and the delay in the standardisation of receivers and other instruments.
