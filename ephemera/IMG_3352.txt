IN what part of the world is to be found to-day the keenest interest in broad- casting?

A distinguished German playwright and novelist, Herr Lion Feuchtwanger, has provoked this question by championing the position of Berlin, which he believes possesses more keen listeners than any other city.

The number of listeners of London or New York, he claims, however well-founded, is a poor criterion of their appreciation of broadcasting.  

It is remembered that Berlin has but little advantage over the other principal cities, and that it is not comparable in population with cities in America, such as New York. State possesses, says Herr Feuchtwanger, meetings and gatherings of the keenest wireless enthusiasts in a larger degree than in any other centre.

Herr Feuchtwanger's assertion has certainly much that can be urged directly for or against it. Readers who care to, must examine for them- selves the detailed development of broadcasting outside Britain and the Empire. Figures in this issue give relative values and afford some basis for speculation.

The figures here given have been compiled from various sources, and references must be made to the table.

In Great Britain, where the licence returns are published monthly, the decimal point is still in the wrong place. Until subscriptiom to the marker, the subscription will continue, as it were, on a post-card system, and there is no necessity to give the detail of the table.

Apart from that comment, when we consider the distribution of broadcasting services in Europe, we find that the number of listeners in Germany has increased by over half a million. In Great Britain the increase has been much more, and has been distributed in accordance with population. In Italy there were only 84,978 listeners at the end of 1926, and this figure did not change greatly in the next few years. In Denmark, however, in 1927 the number of listeners increased by 57,061, and this, on a small population, means a big expansion.

In the Commonwealth of Great Britain and its dependencies the number of listeners in Australia is of most particular interest.

The figures show wonderful growth in Germany. They represent keen listener interest on the Continent, though not in all countries equally. Germany stands in a relatively poor position in 1927, compared with other countries at present. The table given in another part of this page shows the number of listeners in Germany for each million of the population was 182•80 in 1926, and for each thousand inhabitants it was 188•20; and this was the highest figure reached in that country in the first three years of broadcasting.

It may be said that the problem is not with Great Britain, but with Germany, and in what direction the future lies. Broadcasting in Germany is still comparatively expensive. Licences cost 24s. a year, and there are no cheap receivers. The increase in Germany itself will not help to increase the number of listeners in other countries. If broadcasting is to go ahead in the near future in Germany, some change in the fee will be required, or a greater growth in public enthusiasm.

In the other countries of Europe in 1927 the greatest developments have been in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. In Italy, where broadcasting is entirely a State monopoly, the growth has been comparatively slow; and in France the development has not yet reached the stage when a comprehensive listener's service is available.  

Since Denmark stands first to-day as possessing the highest proportion of listeners to population in Europe, the case of that country deserves special analysis.  

In Denmark the growth in the number of listeners between 1925 and 1926 was 54,011, and between 1926 and 1927 the increase was 57,055; that is to say, the rate of increase is still mounting.

In that country, the numbers rose from 118,800 in 1926 from 36•74 per 1,000 to 57•05 per thousand. Denmark had, therefore, at the end of 1927 the highest percentage of listeners in relation to population of any country in Europe.

The others thus position in Europe, both in the actual number of listeners and in the relation of listeners to population, is held by Sweden. The total number of listeners in that country in 1927 was 188,726, and the increase in the year was 40,402. This was equivalent to 40•42 for each thousand inhabitants. This, again, is a very fine perform- ance for a country possessing a total area of more than 170,000 square miles and slightly more than twice that of the United Kingdom.

In Norway, in the same period, the increase in the number of listeners was 21,601, but in neither Britain, Germany, Denmark nor Sweden has the proportion of listeners been lower than in the United Kingdom. We have, per 1,000 of the population, the number of licences standing as follows:—Britain, 35•47; Germany, 32•46; Denmark, 57•05; Sweden, 40•42; Norway, 27•29; Holland, 22•29; Austria, 36•76; Switzerland, 19•39; Czecho-Slovakia, 17•62; Hungary, 14•60; Ireland, 11•62; Lettland, 16•54; Lithuania, 23•83; Poland, 12•79; Finland, 17•06; and Italy, 4•34.

In addition to the figures from European countries, there are a few figures from the Commonwealth. Australasia, and the Union of South Africa are excluded on account of the comparatively small number of licences. In the Commonwealth of Australia the total number of listeners at the end of 1927 was 134,825, giving a proportion of 19•07 licences for each 1,000 of the population. Victoria, with 73,287 licences, had 26•52 per 1,000 of the registra- tions. New South Wales figures of 57,905 represent 18•05. The meritorious character of these figures will be best appreciated when it is realised that although Victoria has an area equal to about half that of England, the total population is slightly more than one-quarter that of the latter country.

In relation to the position in Australia, it must be realised that broadcasting itself only began there in the latter months of 1923. Certain factors which have tended to check the progress have been the great distances, the relatively small population, and the delay in the standardisation of receivers and other instruments.

New Zealand is also beginning to regard broadcast- ing as a factor in her life, and she has now more than 62,000 listeners.

It is in Europe, however, that the progress in broadcasting is to be regarded.

In the columns of World-Radio the interest of our readers must be particularly directed to what is being done at the present time.

Four stations in Austria, at the beginning of the period under review, and Poland were struggling for listener attention. By the end of 1927 the number of listeners in relation to population had changed considerably. In Austria there were 347,107 listeners; and in Poland the number was 247,613.

Germany, with 2,066,761 listeners, had 32•46 per 1,000 inhabitants at the end of 1927; and these figures enable us to compare that country with others.

When it is remembered that the principal station in Austria, and the station in Poland, are both capable of performing a very similar broadcast function, the figures from those countries throw some light on the position.

As was to be expected, the Austrian figures had increased. The official returns for that country showed an increase of 187,572 between the end of 1926 and the end of 1927. There were then the well-known four stations, Vienna, Graz, Innsbruck, and Klagenfurt, and it was not until later that additional transmitters were available. Austria has not yet adequate resources for the service of the whole of the country, and this is one of the causes of the relative paucity of her official figures.  

In Czecho-Slovakia the problem is quite different. There is only one principal broadcast station, which is placed in Prague. The number of listeners there at the end of 1927 is given as 277,102. In Hungary the total number of listeners was 244,773; and 173,744 licensed listeners dated 1927 shows that that country had to contend with some effective competition from foreign stations.  

In Italy 11 stations are in service and they had 285,000 listeners at the end of 1927. This represents 1•05 per 1,000; and it must be said that Italy in the year 1927 increased more modestly than in other directions.
