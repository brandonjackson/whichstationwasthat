DX Work Through the Summer. Fading apart, signal strength has been generally very good indeed. I can see as yet no signs whatever of any marked waning, and I believe that the improved receiving sets of to-day, in conjunction with the higher power of many Continental stations, will enable DX work to be carried on uninterruptedly right through the summer. My own experience last summer was that I was able to log practically the same number of stations as during the darker months, but that in most cases signal strength was less. To my mind summer long-distance work is particularly interesting, for, though during the winter it is easy enough for almost anyone to bring in a considerable number of stations, summer conditions are the real test of the efficiency of the apparatus and of the skill of the operator.

The star stations at the present time are many. Not to mention the German giants, which may be regarded as “fixed stars,” Brussels, Oslo, and Rome have been coming through particularly well. I have had good reception from Gothenburg and have logged both Porsgrund and Falun. Toulouse has suffered more than once from heterodyne interference, but two other French stations, Paris PTT and Petit Parisien, have been at the top of their form. Prague, too, is extraordinarily strong just now, and I have had good reception from Milan, Bruenn, and Munich.
