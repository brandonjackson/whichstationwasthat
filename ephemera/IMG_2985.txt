An Unidentified Transmission.

I wonder if any reader picked up a strong transmission working on approximately 510 m. at 11.30 p.m. on April 21. The announcer was speaking German, but though I listened for some time no indication was given which enabled the station to be identified. Lyons Doua is now an excellent signal, but Paris PTT seems to have found a thoroughly bad spot. All that could be heard of him on several evenings was a weird jumbled noise, which suggested that somebody else was transmitting upon exactly the same wave. Bruenn has been coming in well in some places, though with me he has not been very strong. Fredriksstad has been good at times, as have both Bordeaux Lafayette and Bilbao (EAJ11), provided that only one of them was working at the time. Langenberg seems to vary his power considerably. At times he is a good signal and at others quite poor. Stuttgart is perhaps the strongest transmission on the medium waves just now, though he is run fairly close by Prague, San Sebastian, and Petit Parisien.

I have heard a great number of the Spaniards, including both the Barcelona stations, Bilbao, Radio España, Madrid Union Radio, Seville, Radio Castilla, and Radio Madrileña. The Italians also have been very good, Rome being an exceptionally strong signal, whilst Milan is coming in very well at times, and I have heard something of Naples, despite the heterodynes and spark interference.
