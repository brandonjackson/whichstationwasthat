QRA (Southsea): We know of no official Spanish short wave transmitter, but there are many amateurs. We are making enquiries.
Ether Searcher (Birmingham): 20-30 m. in the short wave band is much too vague; the two most likely English-speaking stations are 2XAG (New York) and 8XK (Schenectady).
G.W.A. (Bradford): Not advertised in programmes, but Kalundborg, relaying 6GB; chimes from the Town Hall at midnight (11 p.m. G.M.T.). Copenhagen had advertised, in error, a relay of London on Sunday, February 19, this was given, instead, on Monday, February 20.
P. C-Album (Coventry): We know of no broadcasting station on such a low WL. Is not this a harmonic? In this case details might tally with the programme from Hanover.
Horner 3 Valve (Sheffield): An amateur transmission, but cannot trace, as you give no call sign.
Bonzo (Finchley): (3) We believe that Hamburg extended its transmission on that evening; possibly you received this through Kiel, (1) Apparently Berlin, working later than advertised in programmes, (2) WPC (Atlantic City).
Wireless Willie (Birmingham): Yes, Copenhagen, relaying dance music from the Restaurant Nimbs.
Super-Het (Edinburgh): We know of no official Spanish station, but we are making enquiries.
Astra (Kings Heath): Dublin, outside relay of football match, also taken by Cork.
Keppel Bay (Birmingham): We very much regret that we cannot trace from the details you have sent us.
Royal Scot (Upper Edmonton): WEAF (New York).
Wireless Joy (Cork): Motala, relaying cabaret from Stockholm, (2) surely Motala, relaying Swedish programme from Stockholm.
P.J.L. (Dublin): Apparently Oslo testing; possibly received through Porsgrund.
Tiffy: Berlin (Witzleben) apparently working later than advertised in programmes.
W.W. (Cleveland Road, Sunderland): (h) Hanover, relaying Hamburg, (j) details very vague; possibly Cologne, (k) Yes, Malmö, (l) Cologne (chimes from the studio), (m) No estimate of WL given; if Spanish, would tally with Barcelona (EAJ1) relaying operetta, The Tempest (Chapi) from Madrid (EAJ7), (n) Cannot trace, we know of no official Spanish station on that WL, but are making enquiries, (o) Münster, relaying dance music from Cologne.
D.V. Super 3 (Dalston): Your condenser readings point to Dublin which was giving dance music at that time (old waltzes).
J.S.S.R. (Narborough): Barcelona (EAJ1) relaying Madrid (EAJ7), The Tempest (Chapi).
Loud Speaker (Essex): We believe this to be Berlin (Witzleben) working later than advertised in programme.
