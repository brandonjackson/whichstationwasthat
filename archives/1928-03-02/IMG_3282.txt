Florian (Teignmouth): Kiel, relaying the Carnival programme from Hamburg.  
Doc (Belfast): Frame aerial was pointing south-east, to Langenberg, relaying dance music from Cologne.  
N. R. Fish (Clapham Common): (1) Umea or Helsingborg, relaying time signal from Stockholm; later followed by cabaret; (2) Prague and Brunn; operatic evening.  
Enquirer (Worthing): You do not say whether this was in English or in a foreign language: if English, a U.S.A. station at that time, but it is impossible to trace as you give no estimate of W.I.  
Twin (Forest Gate): KDKA (East Pittsburgh), Westinghouse Electric Co., U.S.A., 62.5 m.  
Rosso No. 1 (Doncaster): No, WPGf (Atlantic City).  
Chummy Two (Greenock): Copenhagen, English lesson by C. Campbell-McCallum.  
A. L. R. (Stratford): (1) Amateur transmitter testing, (2) Seville (EAJ5) relaying Madrid (EAJ7), (3) aerodrome transmission.  
N. Newman (Rudgwick): No, this was not the rendering of the play, but an English lesson possibly heard from Cologne, which with the time tallies, but cannot confirm as you give no estimate of W.I.  
Errant Three (Croydon): Freiburg, relaying Stuttgart.  
Ark (Todmorden): More probably 6XAR (San Francisco) and 7AQ (not Nebraska).  
Rat (Ratcliffe College, Leicester): No, this was Warsaw News (children's hour).  
H. B. (Millsbridge): Koenigs Wusterhausen (children's hour).  
O. H. V. (Hackney, E.9): Hanover, relaying dance music from the Hamburg studio.  
O. S. (Netherton): It is impossible to trace transmitter in this instance, as your call letters are incorrect.  
H. A. N. (Lancs): Kalundborg, relaying from Copenhagen. Pianoforte recital by Gudrun Seligmann.  
L. A. E. Fosbrooke (Osterley): Yes, either WORD (Batavia, Ill.) or WOK (Chicago, Ill.), both stations work on 252 m.  
Hibernia (Loughrea): (1) Hamar, now on 555.6 m., relaying Oslo; (2) not Riga, W.I. apparently wrong, regret, cannot trace; (3) Porsgrund, relaying Oslo; (4) are you sure this is not Spanish? Your details, and especially the call, all suggest Almeria.  
Angus (Newport, Mon): Details rather vague, but U.S.A. station — possibly WGY (Schenectady).  
M. W. (Prestonkirk): 5NW, amateur transmitter at Dundee.  
R. H. Froud (Enfield): PTT Rennes, relaying concert from the Theatre Mogador at Paris.  
F. J. C. (Southampton): Frankfurt-on-Main, symphony concert. This station has a lady announcer.  
Primrose (Eastbourne): (1) Hanover, relaying Hamburg. Talk by Alice Berend, The Impressions of a Philistine; (2) details rather vague, but apparently either PTT Grenoble or PTT Rennes, relayed by Biarritz PTT Paris.  
Curious (Oxford): Your estimate of W.I. surely wrong; is this Frankfurt-on-Main?
