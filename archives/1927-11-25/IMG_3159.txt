estimate of WL, but possibly Motala, relaying dance music from Stockholm.
High Power (Ponteland): Your estimate of WL is very vague, but possibly Almeria (Spain) on about 326 m., relaying Madrid (EAJ7).
W. J. A: (Palmers Green): The new Italian station (not yet identified with certainty) relaying Milan.
Jonnie and Ronnie (Redhill): See previous answer.
Willie: Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen. Chimes from the Town Hall at midnight (11 p.m., G.M.T.).
C’est Quoi: Huizen (Holland), 1,950 m. Garra (Nr. Cheltenham): Kharkov (Narkomptochte1), 1,700 m., relaying from the State Opera House.
Tranode 3 (E. 11): Yes, possibly KDKA (East Pittsburg), 315.6 m., but cannot confirm as no detailed programmes are available.
Night Hawk (Chatham): Possibly the short wave transmitter at Koenigswusterhausen on about 55 m.
Early Bird (Heanor): (1) We do not think you received WGY direct, but a relay effected by Stuttgart. (2) We cannot trace a station with call sign CNA. Details too vague, cannot trace.
Paddy (St. Annes): Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen. Dance music from the Restaurant Nimb. Chimes from the Town Hall at midnight (11 p.m. G.M.T.).
Ultradion (Birmingham): Madrid (EAJ7) and Cadiz (EAJ3).
Crystalvale: Kalundborg relaying dance music. High Power (Ponteland): Through Kuopio and Michel (Finland), 566 m., 250 w., relays Helsingfors. You would hear the call from the latter station: "Huomio! Huomio! täällä Suomen yleisradio, Helsiniki. Giv akt, giv akt! Här Finlands rundradio, Helsingfors/Helsinki".
Dalton (Norwich): There appears very little doubt that this was a test made by Munich previous to a relay which was advertised as taking place on Sunday, November 20.
Gasworks (Leith): (1) If WL correct, WGY (Schenectady), 379 m.; (2) possibly WBZ (Springfield), but cannot confirm as no detailed programmes available.
P.M. 2 3 Valve: No, if WL approximately correct, Bilbao (EAJ11), 418 m.
Dan (Ranelagh): Your details are so vague; you do not say whether in a foreign or in the English language. At that time possible an amateur transmitter.
L. E. D. (Oxford): Motala, relaying Stockholm (a relay of foreign stations). See programme in World-Radio.
3 Valver (Leith): Moscow Comintern (RDW).
E. A. (Wells): (1) Possibly Kharkov (Narkomptochtshel), 1,700 m.; (2) are you sure this was below 5XX?; details would tally with Norddeich (Germany), 1,829 m. Weather report; (3) Leningrad.
