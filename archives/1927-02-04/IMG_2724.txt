Sure, here’s the transcription:

possibly Moscow, 1,010 m. Paul Bailey (Belfast): No, Leipzig.  
Jay Kay (Cumberland): Karlsborg (a dramatic recital).  
Dr. H. E. (1) Llanelly: WGY (Schenectady).  
Four-Valve (York): PTT, Paris relaying dance music from Coliseum in that city.  
Roy Freeman (Cheltenham): Leipzig relaying Berlin.  
Blacker (Bordon): You do not state whether a.m. or p.m., and your estimated WL is very vague, but the programme tallies with Frankfort-on-Main.  
Bleu (Kensington): No, this quite agrees with the Langenberg transmission on that date.  
Taffy (Northrop): No, Frederiksstad: Porsgrund is on 504 m. between Aberdeen and Brussels.  
G. E. C. 4: You do not state time of transmission, but items tally with a broadcast from Leipzig on that date.  
One Valve (Bognor): Leipzig.  
Vulcan 2 V (Northwich): Yes, Langenberg.  
Super-Heterodyn (Sunbury): No date given; Madrid (EAJ7) frequently gives late transmissions of dance music.  
Beachurst (Dover): Frankfort-on-Main.  
Panshine (Sheffield): Vienna (high-power station).  
Holloway (E.C.2): Rome.  
Brand Loughton: What you heard was “Frankfurt-am-Main in Kassel.”  
Mix (Finchley): (1) Frankfort-on-Main; (2) Radio-Paris. A short sermon and service are given every Sunday at 12.15 (old day).  
W. Symonds (Ashford): Koenigs Wusterhausen relaying Berlin on 1,300 m.  
Tremewan (Perranporth): Frankfort-on-Main. Tune “Austria” is the German National Anthem.  
F. F. F. (Sheffield): Yes, Leipzig.  
Chase (Doncaster): Cannot trace as you give no date.  
Ormiston (Dublin): Moscow (RDW).  
Solodyne: (1) Bordeaux-Lafayette (France); (2) Milan.  
Gwynne 2: probably an amateur transmission.  
Inglaterra: (1) Moscow (RDW); (2) cannot confirm, but believe this was the new Paris station, “Radio-St. Vitus,” operating on about 808 m.  
Langton (N. 12): No, we do not believe that this could have been the Adelaide broadcasting station as if hour is worked out, this would mean a transmission in that city at 11.45 a.m. It is more than probable that you actually picked up an American transmitter which used the words heard.  
Heterodyne: details given are somewhat vague, but possibly Stettin relaying an operetta, “The Postmistress” (music by Leon Jessel), at Berlin; if definitely opera, Dresden relaying Humperdinck’s Konigskinder as performed at the New Theatre, Leipzig.  
W. D. Giles (Eccles): Radio-Toulouse.  
Centre-Hall: (1) cannot trace - does not tally with Stockholm programme; (2) Nuremburg relaying.
