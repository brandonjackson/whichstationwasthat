Withypool: In the official advertised programmes, Dortmund and Muenster were the only German stations taking the Langenberg dance music on that night. It is, of course, quite possible that another German station took the same entertainment. Your estimation of WL. would point to either Koenigsberg or Nuremberg, but these transmitters were apparently doing their own programmes. Mac (Porto): You do not give any estimated WL., but call heard would tally with San Sebastian, EAJ8 ("Eh-ah-ho-ta-ocho") possibly relaying Madrid (EAJ7). Do not know of any Spanish station with call EAJ14. Jill (S.E. 11): Hilversum (1,060 m.) Symphony concert. H. Hodgson (Southsea): Cannot understand your estimated WL., which is very far wrong. This English talk on Shelley by Miss Stella. Mead was broadcast by PTT Paris on 464 m., and by Eiffel Tower on 2650 m. Cob (Stourbridge): Langenberg (468 m.), gramophone records followed by talk ("Five Minutes for Housewives"). Jay Pip (Dover): Cannot trace unless some estimation of WL. is given. 2VH 80: Nuremberg (303 m.) relaying orchestra concert from the Hotel Stadt Wien at Munich. Three Valves (Walton-on-Thames): (1) Dortmund (283 m.) relaying dance music from Langenberg until 1 a.m. on 5/6/32; (2) aerodrome transmission (900 m.). Insultator (King's Cross): Madrid (EAJ7) 375 m. Selection from opera Rigoletto (Verdi). See programme in World-Radio. S. R. (Kettering): Rome (450 m.) Special Beethoven Centenary concert, with solos and chorus. Corona (Kettering): Cannot trace, unless a relay of Stockholm, which possibly worked later than advertised in programmes. R. A. J. B. (Cosham): (1) Electric clock in studio; (2) Porsgrund (504 m.) relaying English lesson from Oslo; (3) Bergen (370 m.) 'cello recital, followed by news and weather report; (4) Bratislava (30 m.) Talk followed by relay of concert from Prague; (5) Hamburg (394 m.) Opera from the State Theatre, followed by relay of concert at the Alster Pavilion; (6) Petit Parisien, Paris (340 m.). Binkey (Las Palmas): (1) Yes, undoubtedly Dortmund (283 m.) relaying dance music from Langenberg until midnight; (2) WL. is surely wrong - details would tally with Cassel (272.7 m.), which was giving dance music from studio at that time, and there is a lady announcer at this station. Chitos (Sheffield): Dresden (276.2 m.) relaying dance music from Leipzig. R. A. B. (Cosham): (1) If French, PTT Lyons, (478 m.), (2) Yes, Dublin (319 m.) relaying programme from Cork.
