Parkin (Nottingham): (1) Stettin relaying dance music from Berlin, (2) Cassel, relaying Frankfort, (3) Dortmund (283 m.) relaying Langenberg, (4) too vague, possibly Cadiz, (5) Madrid (EAJ7).

Triple Valve (Newcastle): Yes, probably Hilversum (school transmission) with recitations by an actor.
W. G. Morris (Bow): Details and WL. are much too vague; there are at least 50 stations between your stated WLL.
Radiano Three (Rumney): Scheveningen-Haven, Holland (News only).
P/R5242: Cannot trace your third enquiry under nom de plume of "Inglaterra" (May 13), possibly Bordeaux-Lafayette, which at present is testing on various WLL.

Nenbekket (Antwerp): (1) 5 G. B. testing on 326 m. (2) Every evening, according to our information.
R. W. A. Keith (Liverpool): (1) The only German stations on that WL. are Cassel and Danzig.

RAJ22, possibly relaying Madrid (EAJ7); (4) yes, Leipzig; (5) WL. must be wrong, and details too vague, cannot trace.
Wondering ? (N.W.6): (1) Warsaw (1,111 m.), Sor0 (1,150 m.), Boden (1,200 m.) and Motala (1,304 m.) were all giving dance music during that time. WL. is too indefinite to identify which of these transmissions were heard. (2) Nuremberg (303 m.), relaying dance music.
Detector (Glasgow): Yes, Leipzig (365 m.) which gave dance music until midnight.

Leeds: can trace no relay of the opera, Rigoletto, from details given in European programmes, but possibly this was Bilbao, EAJ11 (no programmes available) or Radio Toulouse, which frequently relays from the Théâtre de la Capitole in that city, without previous warning.
R. M. K. (Edinburgh): This was Prague, 348.9 m. (native name : Praha). Worked later than advertised in programmes.
Safety (Bexhill-on-Sea): We cannot trace any French station on that WL., but details might fit in with the PTT Paris transmission, in which case possibly Grenoble advertised on a WL. of 350 m.
F. Green (Foulridge): (1) cannot trace without estimated WL.; possibly short wave transmitter, Berlin on 58 m., (2) cannot trace without estimated WL., (3) KDKA (East Pittsburgh) shortwave transmitter on 63 m.
3MT/CRS (Sheerness): Not Radio Vitus, Paris, but Marseilles relaying PTT Paris.
J. E. H. (Rhonda): (1) PTT Lyons, relaying PTT Paris, (2) do not understand WL. as this was without doubt Motala’s relay of the Stockholm programme. WL. should be 1,304 m.
Vander (Brussels): Motala ne transmett que les programmes de Stockholm. Les détails donnés coincident avec Stockholm, le 14 mai, et nous ne doutons pas que vous avez entendu Motala. Nous ne comprenons pas la longueur d’onde; elle devrait être de 1,304 mètres.
Tim (W. 12): Rome (450 m.) relaying orchestral concert from the Quirinal Hotel.
E. O. J. Woodward (Ilford): Prague (348.9 m.).
BM/RDDB: Rome (450 m.) relaying from theatre.

Electron (Eastbourne): (1) cannot trace, unless Milan, which probably worked later than advertised in pro­grammes; (2) details are too vague; regret cannot trace (3) can trace no station between 312.5 m.

Tuff (Surbiton): We do not know of a German station on this wavelength, but Holland has been testing on 1,870 metres, as this is the wavelength now allotted to the new (proposed) Huizen transmitter.
Amant de Radio (Uxbridge): (1) Naples; (2) Langenberg (extended trans­mission); (3) cannot definitely identify this transmission; we believe it was a test made by PTT Paris.
J. W. B. (Malta): Gothenberg relaying dance music from Stockholm.
J. S. (Sparkhill): This transmission is not advertised in any Continental programme, but we believe that it was a test made by PTT Paris; you may have received it through PTT Lyons.

Dovercourt: Moscow (Komintern). Leipzig (extended dance transmission). 2 Valve H-in-A;
