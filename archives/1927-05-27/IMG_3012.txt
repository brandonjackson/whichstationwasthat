Brussels): Motala ne transmet que des programmes de Stock­holm. Les détails donnés coïncident avec Stockholm, le 14 mai, et nous ne doutons pas que vous avez entendu Motala. Nous ne comprenons pas la longueur d'onde; elle devrait être de 1,304 metres.
Tim (W. 12): Rome (450 m.) relaying orchestral concert from the Quirinal Hotel.
E. J. Woodward (Ilford): Prague (348·9 m.).
BM/RDDB: Rome (450 m.) relaying from theatre.
F. G. N. (Reading): (1) No, not Moscow, but Stockholm (454 m.) giving dance music at that time; (2) no, Fredrikstad, relaying Oslo. Apparently working later than advertised in programmes; (3) Petit Parisien, Paris (340 m.).
A. Z. N (N. Kensington): W.L. vague, possibly Nuremberg (303 m.) relaying dance music from the Reichsadler Hotel at Munich.
Hibernia: (1) Cadiz (EAJ3) on 400 m. (new wavelength), possibly relaying Madrid (EAJ7); (2) yes, Berne (411 m.) relaying Geneva. Marriage of Figaro (Mozart) relayed from the Grand Theatre, Geneva.
Electron (Eastbourne): (1) cannot trace, unless Milan, which probably worked later than advertised in pro­grammes; (2) details are too vague; regret cannot trace (3) can trace no station between 312.5 m. (Newcastle) and 315 m. (Breslau); (4) PTT Marseille (308 m.); and Milan (322 m.); (5) if W.L. correct, Zagreb (310 m.) relaying opera from the National Theatre; (6) Radio Madrileña (EAJ12) relaying Madrid (EAJ7).
H. Tuffen (Surbiton): cannot definitely confirm, but possibly Belgrade on 1,650 metres, if you are convinced that this was not Radio-Paris on 1,750 metres. This station works at 10.30 a.m., giving news and a short concert.
Tuff (Surbiton): We do not know of a German station on this wavelength, but Holland has been testing on 1,870 metres, as this is the wavelength now allotted to the new (proposed) Huizen transmitter.
Amant de Radio (Uxbridge): (1) Naples; (2) Langenberg (extended trans­mission); (3) cannot definitely identify this transmission; we believe it was a test made by PTT Paris.
J. W. B. (Malta): Gothenberg relaying dance music from Stockholm.
J. S. (Sparkhill): This transmission is not advertised in any Continental programme, but we believe that it was a test made by PTT Paris; you may have received it through PTT Lyons.
Chariot (Cottingham): Too vague both in regard to wavelength and details. According to programme it was not Rome.
Rover (Chester): Hanover (own concert).
