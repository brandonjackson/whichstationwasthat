Parkin (Nottingham): (1) Stettin relaying dance music from Berlin, (2) Cassel, relaying Frankfort, (3) Dortmund (283 m.) relaying Langenberg, (4) too vague, possibly Cadiz, (5) Madrid (EAJ7).  
Spaniola (West Hartlepool): Programme items would tally with Madrid (EAJ7), 375 m.  
Triple Valve (Newcastle): Yes, probably Hilversum (school transmission) with recitations by an actor.  
W. G. Morris (Bow): Details and WL. are much too vague; there are at least 50 stations between your stated WLL.  
Radiano Three (Rumney): Scheveningen-Haven, Holland (News only).  
P/R5242: Cannot trace your third enquiry under nom de plume of "Inglaterra" (May 13), possibly Bordeaux-Lafayette, which at present is testing on various WLL.  
F. C. C. 4 (Anerley): If WL. correct, Boden (1,200 m.) relaying dance music from Stockholm, but more likely to be Motala in 1,304 m.  
G. H. W. (Sittingbourne): (1) Barcelona (EAJ1), 343.8 m. (2) Madrid (EAJ7), (3) yes, Langenberg (468 m.). Was working until 9 a.m.  
Silvester (Hull): Radio Madrilena (EAJ12), 300 m. relaying Madrid (EAJ7). Programme in commemoration of the twenty-fifth Anniversary of Coronation of King Alfonso.  
Nasus (Atherstone): Scheveningen-Haven, Holland (news only).  
Ajax (Dalston): Apparently Italian amateur transmitter.  
G. H. M. (Notts): 6LF call-sign has apparently changed hands, as it previously belonged to a Wigan amateur.  
Mac (Porto): Cadiz (EAJ3) experimental concert.  
Potterer (Stoke-on-Trent): Probably Stettin (new transmitter on about 235 m.) relaying Berlin.  
Evans (Portsmouth): Insufficient address sent for postal reply.  
A. S. W. (Newhaven): 30.2 m. Nenbekket (Antwerp): (1) 5 G. B. testing on 326 m. (2) Every evening, according to our information.  
R. W. A. Keith (Liverpool): (1) The only German stations on that WL. are Cassel and Danzig. Cassel was giving dance music at that time, and Danzig closed down at 10.30 p.m. but Posen on 270.3 m. relayed an outside broadcast from Warsaw; (2) Kiel, relaying Bremen (concert from Sollner's Wine Bar); (3) Salamanca (402.5 m.) RAJ22, possibly relaying Madrid (EAJ7); (4) yes, Leipzig; (5) WL. must be wrong, and details too vague, cannot trace.  
Wondering ? (N.W.6): (1) Warsaw (1,111 m.), Sor0 (1,150 m.), Boden (1,200 m.) and Motala (1,304 m.) were all giving dance music during that time. WL. is too indefinite to identify which of these transmissions were heard. (2) Nuremberg (303 m.), relaying dance music.
