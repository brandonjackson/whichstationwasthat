It (Greenock): 5SW, B.B.C. experimental station at Chelmsford.

We are Seven (Stroud): An amateur transmission (gramophone records), but cannot trace as you give no call sign.

Trebor: Yes, Falun, relaying Stockholm. Milngavie 5NW, amateur transmitter at Dundee.

R. N. V. R. (Leicester): Edinburgh, relaying from the Marine Gardens, Portobello concert by the Ambassador's Orchestra.

Fretful (Liverpool): (a) Madrid (EAJ7) Children's Hour; (b) apparently an amateur transmission; cannot trace any programme to tally with your details.

Knot Twister (Willlesley): Hilversum (Hawaiian music).

A. I. F. (Portsmouth): Amateur transmitter; cannot trace as call sign is incomplete.

Nigger (Leeds), Undergraduate (Cambridge): J. V. D. (Newcastle-on-Tyne); Mr. Er Er (Seaforth): Suva toll. Edinburgh, relaying concert by the Ambassador's Orchestra from the Marine Gardens, Portobello.

Retta (Syston): Moscow Comintern (RDW).

The Ilford Straight Four: Talk not advertised in programme, but apparently Marseilles, relaying PTT Paris.
