Fragment: Wilno.

Leo (Somerset): (7) Cracow; (8) regret, cannot trace.

Nulla Bona (Sligo): Yes, WGY (Schenectady) received direct.

L. M. R. D. (Winchester): It is impossible to trace transmissions from condenser readings alone; some estimate of WL. must be given; many stations broadcast dance music on Sunday nights.

Spooner (Norfolk): Apparently PTT Lille, but not advertised in programmes.

Fretwork (Ken): PTT Lille.

Curious (Cardiff): An amateur transmitter, but cannot trace as you give no call sign.

Spencer Park (Coventry): This appears to have been Hanover (probably relaying Hamburg) which later took the Lindbergh broadcast from WGY (Schenectady).

Auctions (Thirsk): We regret, but cannot trace; many short wave stations are now experimenting.

Sligachau (Ches.): We cannot confirm from the foreign programmes that Jan Kiepura broadcast from any Continental station on that evening; possibly gramophone records.

Franciscus: A Polish station broadcasting election results with gramophone records in the intervals, but cannot say which as you give no estimate of WL. and condenser readings do not help.

Caret Cross (Carlisle): Moscow Comintern (RDW). We recognise call sign, but an amateur experimental transmitter.

Ciego (Blackheath): Cannot confirm as you do not give WL., but would tally with Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen.

Investigateur (Malvern): PTT Paris, relaying dance music from the Coliseum.

Four Valver (Bromboro Port): PTT Rennes, relaying PTT Paris.

Le Chandelier (Alfred de Musset), New Imp (Goodmayes): We believe that Stockholm relayed on that night.

Viking (Dronfield, nr. Sheffield): Warsaw (concert of gramophone records).

V.L. (Liverpool): A relay of Stockholm; opera La Bohème (Puccini), relayed from the Royal Opera House.

Tombo (Bayswater): Münster.

BM/EBVB (W. 6.): (1) PTT Rennes; (2) the nearest German station above Cologne is Hanover; (3) it was Stettin, relaying the Berlin programme (chamber music).

Levedge (Bolton): WL. wrong; English lesson from Cologne, you may have picked this up direct, or from Aix-la-Chapelle.

Ambulator (Eastbourne): Breslau, relaying from the Café Hindenburg at Beuthen (Silesia).

Caret Cross (Carlisle): Probably an amateur transmission, regret, cannot trace.

Gran (Doncaster): A test through 2LO.

Beacon Radio (S.E.): Malmö relaying Stockholm; also Göteborg on 416 m.

H.F. 42: (a) AFK (Doebberitz) on 37.65 m.; (b) this was 2FC testing through
