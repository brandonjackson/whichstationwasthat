Sure, here's the transcription:

Skipper (Great Yarmouth): Cannot confirm, but believe this is a transmission from De Bilt (KNMI), Holland, on 1,100 m. Meteorological forecasts are broadcast four times daily, and it is probable that as a Government station, it also sends out a time signal. We do not recognise the call sign. 
J. E. H. (Rhondda): (1) Probably Cadiz (EAJ3) experimental concert; (2) Nuremberg relaying dance music from Munich; (3) Falun relaying dance music from Stockholm; (4) Yes, if W.L. correct, should be WJAZ (Chicago), but cannot check programme.
E. H. Johnson (Portslade): (1) PTT Paris, 8. a.m., News, 2.10 p.m. afternoon concert; (2) PTT Lyons relaying the afternoon concert from PTT Paris.
Ore (Bedminster): On June 28, 29 and 30, Koenigsusterhausen, Berlin, Langenberg and Stuttgart broadcast a programme of gramophone records from 4.30 to 7.30 a.m. You heard Koenigsusterhausen. See Eclipse list of foreign transmissions in World-Radio, issue 24/6/27, No. 100.
M. R. E. (S.W.1): Dortmund relaying dance music from Cologne via Langenberg. 
Sunbeam (Workington): Dortmund (relaying dance music from Cologne via Langenberg until 1 a.m. 3/7/27. See programme in World Radio.
Straight Two (Allerton): Apparently gramophone records, but without some estimated W.L. it is impossible to identify transmitter. Most of the long-wave stations were broadcasting dance music.
M. M. (Manchester): Details are too vague - can trace no French station working at that time.
Jaybejay (Edinburgh): Sorö relaying Copenhagen. Dance music relayed from the Restaurant Nimb. Midnight chimes relayed from the Town Hall. See programme in World Radio.
D.K. Fiend (Nuneaton): Possibly Radio Toulouse, which uses a metronome as an interval signal. Coupon must be sent with each enquiry.
Ninety Second: Freiburg relaying dance music from Frankfurt-on-Main.
Boston: Possibly Belgrade testing (about 1,650 m.).
10001 (Jersey): New station at Rennes (Brittany) (320 m.) relay of PTT Paris.
A. Rhodes (Watford): Details and W.L. are very vague - possibly Langenberg.
Blink Bonny (Bournemouth): Eiffel Tower relaying PTT Paris. Dance music from the Coliseum (Eiffel Tower, Worry): Bell Telephone Company, Canada (26.18 m.) working in connection with the Beam station at Drummondville, Quebec.
B. H. Roper (Guernsey): Coupon relaying Weather Report and News from Dublin. Coupon must be sent with each enquiry.
