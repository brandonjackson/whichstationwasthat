<code>(Guernsey): Motala (1,304 m.), relaying Stockholm. Stalled concert followed by dance music.</code>

<code>H. Hibbs (Portland): (1) Langenberg (468 m.); (2) Leipzig (365 m.) News, followed by dance music.</code>

<code>Neutrodyne (Dorking): We do not know of a KDKA official relay on 21.5 m., but U.S.A. stations are experimenting on many short wavelengths.</code>

<code>Reinarfz (Edgware): The École Supérieure des PTT Paris, relayed the speeches from the banquet given by the American Chamber of Commerce, Paris, to the U.S.A. aviators (Commander Byrd, etc.). The transmission was taken by all PTT relays, including the Eiffel Tower. You received this from PTT Paris (464 m.).</code>

<code>H. F. 42 (Regent’s Park): Very vague, possibly Juan-les-Pins, with which time and style of broadcast would tally.</code>

<code>R. Brand (Loughton): The École Supérieure des PTT Paris relayed the speeches from the banquet given by the American Chamber of Commerce to the U.S.A. aviators (Commander Byrd, etc.). The transmission was relayed to all PTT stations, including the Eiffel Tower. You received this through PTT Lille (287 m.).</code>

<code>Stoker-Schnell: (1) Possibly French Military station OCMV (Mount Valérien, Paris) on 39 m. (2) Cannot trace, details too vague.</code>

<code>Bridge (Bells Hill): (1) Noms-de-plume must be accompanied by senders’ name and address. The language was probably French; an aircraft and aerodrome interchange of messages.</code>

<code>(2) With the exception of the first (Air Ministry) these were all amateur transmissions. We cannot undertake to give these addresses.</code>

<code>BM/GAFW (Luddenden): Koenigswusterhausen taking dance music from Berlin studio.</code>

<code>M. Ellison (Ballymoney, Co. Antrim): Through Marseilles, you heard the speeches given at the banquet offered by the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris to Commander Byrd and his companions; they were relayed by PTT Paris to all the official French stations including Eiffel Tower.</code>

<code>S. R. D. (Earsdon): See previous reply. You do not state wavelength, so we cannot possibly tell you through which station you heard this transmission.</code>

<code>Quatre V (Pontypool): See reply to Ellison (Ballymoney).</code>

<code>Ailing Night (Alton): You must give your name and address, with a nom-de-plume. Your enquiry is not clear. Were the Tennis Notes broadcast in English? We can trace no transmission at that time of this nature from any European station. The chimes followed by dance music would indicate Langenberg, but in that case your wavelength is wrong.</code>
