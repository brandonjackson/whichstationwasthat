Errant Three (W. Croydon): (1) Possibly Lille, relaying Paris (PTT); (2) Wavelength of Juan-les-Pins indefinite at present; (3) Cassel has changed to 236.2 m. Sobanan: Yes, Glasgow. Granny 5 Valve Solodyne (Lasswade): Leningrad. Mac (Porto): Your dial readings are very little guide, but we suggest the following: (1) Leningrad; (2) Hilversum, Ocete, N. 10; (1) Wavelength doubtful; possibly Radio Lyon; (2) Falun (Sweden). Alicia (Hounslow): Probably WHAM (Rochester, N.Y.). J. F. S. (Tidworth): Surely the wavelength is wrongly estimated. L. O. G. (Dunfermline): You do not give any indication of wavelength, without which we cannot give the information. DEV (Finchley): Swedish relay station, probably Trollhättan if your estimate of wavelength is correct. Novice (Stamford): Not an American station. Your estimate of wavelength is very doubtful. Claybos (Hamilton): Kalundborg relaying Copenhagen. Dance music. Novice (Barnsley): Probably Kovno, which was broadcasting Rigoletto. Which wedding march? Seeker (Bradford): Yes, Leningrad. A Rum'un: Aberdeen relaying Edinburgh. Ova 2: 2FC (S.W.) is heard occasionally. A. R. M.

R. N. V. R. (Leicester): Warsaw. Lonnie (Chester): Kalundborg relaying Copenhagen. Earlyriser (Essex): According to your dial readings, Motala, but "Austrian National Anthem" disagrees.

Midge (Bolton): More probably Kalundborg, in spite of your estimate of wavelength. Geo Whizz, H. B. S.: (1) Kattowitz; (2) Rennes. Concert (Yorks.): Details of wavelength too vague. Leningrad indicated, but programme does not tally. Puzzling (Robin's Hood Bay): Impossibly vague. Please be far more definite in particulars. Eric's E. S. 3 Valve: (1) Cassel, relaying Frankfurt; (2) Bremen relaying Hamburg; (3) If wavelength approximately correct, Leipzig, which relayed Berlin dance music at that time. Robinson Crusoe: Impossible to say without some knowledge of wavelength. De Luxe Receiver (Yorks.): You give no idea of the wavelength, impossible to trace. P. A. Wigley (Evesham): Langenberg, broadcasting the operetta Adrienne. J. K. M. (Barnet): You give no idea of the wavelength, therefore your estimates are too vague. Probably Moscow.
