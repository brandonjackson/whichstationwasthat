Lewdeb (Birmingham): (1) Are you sure it was not KDKA? (2) None but stations of very low power round this wavelength; (3) Possibly WBAL (Baltimore); (4) Suggest WADC (Akron, Ohio); (5) WOC (Davenport, Iowa); (6) KGO (Oakland, Cal.); (7) Probably WLS (Chicago); (8) This may have been WOK (Chicago), WORD (Batavia, Ill.) or WMBB (Homewood, Ill.).

4 Valver (Kent): (1) Hamburg; (2) Amateur; (3) Probably Hanover relaying Hamburg. 

Bondi (Edgware): (1) probably WPG, Atlantic City; (2) WEAF; (3) Impossible to be precise. Probably a Swedish station, say Malmö; (4) Juan-les-Pins (Nice); Wavelength 257 m. (5) Nürnberg relaying Munich; (6) probably Radio Béziers.
