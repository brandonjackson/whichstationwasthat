Stage (Gloucester): Probably direct. Glenbuck (Surbiton): Cannot trace such a transmission on that wavelength. Volti Subito (Denbigh): Probably Hilversum. Does not accord with Leningrad’s programme. W. J. (Joppa): Probably an American station, but dial reading alone is insufficient guide. Solodyne (Lasswade): Coupon must be sent for each enquiry. 
Reinartz (N.12): You were presumably receiving Moscow. 
A. P. S. (Birmingham): Information too vague. No coupons sent. 
Nurik (Belfast): Programme of first part tallies with Dublin; second part cannot be traced on estimated wavelength. 
A. L. R. (Stratford): (1) perhaps Radio Espana, if language agrees; (2) Madrid; (3) more likely Lyons (La Doua); (4) cannot identify amateur. 
Rosedale (Sheffield): Unless you are sure of approximate wavelength you heard Fredrikssdad relaying Oslo’s retransmission of other stations. 
Anode Bird (Buckingham): Probably Moscow, and programmes agree, but languages suggested are somewhat doubtful. 
S. I. T. I. (Italy): Surely your estimate of wavelength is incorrect. We cannot trace this item on any such wavelength and shall be interested to know if you hear this station again.
Ascaria Grove (Bristol): Stuttgart relaying Berlin, which at 9 p.m. began broadcast of water polo. 
Werzhof (Nottingham): Radio Toulouse. 
W. L. D. (Annonfor): Koenigs-wusterhausen transmission of gramophone records. 
Toreador (Middleton): Amateur (Leeds). 
H. F. 42 (a): (1) if wavelength correct, Biarritz; (2) cannot trace on that wavelength; (3) probably Radio Beziers. 
R. N. B. (U.S.A.): (1) London; (2) Manchester; (3) Belfast; (4) Newcastle; (5) Stuttgart; (6) Frankfurt; (7) Madrid (EAJ7); (8) cannot trace; (9) Barcelona; (10) Iceland or Naples; (11) Bandoeng (Java).
Winkle (Nottingham): Are you sure of approximate wavelength? Cannot trace.
