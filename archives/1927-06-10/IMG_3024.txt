Barumite: I call 6QW, amateur of Bristol.

S.A.O. (Norwich): Moscow (1,450 m.).

J.H.R. (Scarthoe): W.L. very vague, but possibly Breslau (315 m.) which was relaying an orchestral concert from the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten at that time.

G. and G. (Glasgow): Several German stations broadcast dance music on Sunday evening. Cannot identify transmitter from data of coils given. 2LO stand-by transmitter.

Clontarf (Dublin): Details rather vague, but possibly Rome testing. We cannot accept proprietary names as noms de plume.

P.J. Dibble (Ipswich): Cannot trace "1812" overture in any European programme; it is impossible to identify transmitter from your condenser readings.

Crystol (Goring): Nuremberg (303 m.) relaying orchestral concert from the Hotel Der Reichsadler at Munich.

R.W.A. Keith (Liverpool): (1) Stettin (236 m.) relaying dance music from Berlin; (2) Hanover (297 m.) relaying concert from Café Continental.

Fellowphone (Brighton): Possibly a test, but it is impossible to trace as your estimated W.L. is too vague - might be Motala on 1,304 m.

B. Brennan (Deal): (1) Stamboul (1,200 m.); (2) W.L. vague, but possibly Moscow giving University course.

Thankyou (Ashbourne): W.L. very wrong: possibly Budapest (555 m.). Other stations on near W.L. all giving dance music at that time, except Sevastopol (545 m.) which was relaying speech in Russian.

Turkey (Reading): There is no broadcasting station at Porth, Glam., and it is hardly likely that you would hear an amateur transmitter of that district. Although your estimated W.L. does not tally, it is possible that this was the Cork station. If you mean midday, Cork relays gramophone transmissions from Dublin; if you really mean midnight, the station may have been effecting tests.

Straight Four (Manchester): (5) Either Hamburg (394 m.) or Bremen (400 m.) which were both relaying an orchestral concert from the Alster Pavilion; (6) If W.L. correct, possibly Bilbao (EAJ11) 423 m.

Miles of Shortwave 2 (Eastbourne): (1) Yes, 2XAF (Schenectady) 32.77 m.; (2) too vague, cannot trace; (3) UHU does not appear to be an International call sign; a German transmitter, but cannot identify; (4) Yes, WIZ (New Brunswick) 43.5 m.; (5) Without doubt a German amateur transmission, but failing call sign, we cannot identify.

Listener (York): Your W.L. is apparently wrong; both Langenberg (468 m.), relaying from the Rheinterrasse at Düsseldorf, and PTT Paris, relaying from Coliseum, were giving dance music. Most of the continental stations when giving English and American jazz songs announce the titles in English.

Withypool: Warsaw

Ambrose (Bexhill-on-Sea): Dublin (319 m.).

Breslau in background.

Hibernian (Loughrea): Falun (434 m.) relaying Stockholm.

R.C. 3 (Belfast): (1) Possibly Falun
