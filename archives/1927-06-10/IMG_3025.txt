Sure! Here's the transcription:

Straight Four (Manchester): (5) Either Hamburg (394 m.) or Bremen (400 m.) which were both relaying an orchestral concert from the Alster Pavilion; (6) If WL. correct, possibly Bilbao (EAJ11) 423 m. miles.  
Shortwave 2 (Eastbourne): (1) Yes, 2XAF (Schenectady) 32.7 m.; (2) too vague, cannot trace; (3) UHF does not appear to be an International call sign; a German transmitter, but cannot identify; (4) Yes, WIZ (New Brunswick) 43.5 m.; (5) Without doubt a German amateur transmission, but failing call sign, we cannot identify.  
Listener (York): Your WL. is apparently wrong; both Langenberg (468 m.) relaying from the Rheinterrasse at Düsseldorf, and PTT Paris, relaying from Coliseum, were giving dance music. Most of the continental stations when giving English and American jazz songs announce the titles in English.  
Withypool: Warsaw (1,111 m).

Hibernia (Loughrea): Falun (357 m.) relaying Stockholm.

Midget (West Bromwich): Motala (1,304 m.) relaying news and weather report from Stockholm, followed by dance music from Gothenberg.  
Super-Het (Upper Tooting): (1) Yes, would tally with Madrid (EAJ 7) on 375 m. (2) Your WL. is very vague but possibly Madrid-España (EAJ 2).
