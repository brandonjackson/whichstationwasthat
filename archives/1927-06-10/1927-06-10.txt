S. Noble (N. 4): Not Stamboul, which transmits on 1,200 m., and time would roughly tally with Dortmund, relaying dance music from Cologne.
Roy (Fulham): Berne (411 m.) relaying orchestral concert from Kursaal. Apparently worked later than advertised in programmes.

Videx (Bury St. Edmunds): Yes, Eiffel Tower. Relay of Carillon concert from Cathedral of St. Quentin (Aisne) via PTT Paris (Sunday afternoon transmission).
Kilkenny Variometer (Ireland): With coils mentioned, you could not tune in 600 m.; this was Koenigs Wusterhausen on 1,250 m.
Bartley 5 (Southampton): Possibly Biarritz on 200 m., but cannot confirm.
Wycombe Wanderer: WLW (Cincinnati), 558.5 m.
Seer (Walthamstow): Leningrad (1,000 m.).
J. H. H. (Rhondda): (1) if WL correct, Milan (322 m.). Apparently worked later than advertised in programmes. (2) Cadiz (400 m.) experimental concert.
Three Valve Dual (Glasgow): WL. is very vague, but possibly Milan (322 m.). Although not advertised in programme, this station apparently extended its transmission on that night, as confirmed by other listeners.
Toc H (Norfolk): Falun (357 m.) relaying Stockholm.
Sparks (Manchester): (1) yes, Petit Parisien, announcements in both the French and English languages; (2) 2UA, amateur, of Irlam, Manchester, 6HB, amateur, of Urmston, Manchester, 5II, amateur, cannot trace, 6NI, amateur, Bootle, Lancs.
Victor (Hull): details and WL. much too vague; regret cannot trace.
O-V-1 Schnell: short wave transmitter (58 m.) Berlin.
Bemi (Liverpool): (1) Koenigs Wusterhausen was relaying Breslau at that time on 29.5 m. This was Gleiwitz (250 m.) relaying Breslau; (2) Munster (241 m.) relaying Langenberg; (3) Dresden (294 m.) relaying dance music from Leipzig.

J.H.R. (Scarthoe): W.L. very vague, but possibly Breslau (315 m.) which was relaying an orchestral concert from the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten at that time.
G. and G. (Glasgow): Several German stations broadcast dance music on Sunday evening. Cannot identify transmitter from data of coils given. 2LO stand-by transmitter.
Clontarf (Dublin): Details rather vague, but possibly Rome testing. We cannot accept proprietary names as noms de plume.
P.J. Dibble (Ipswich): Cannot trace "1812" overture in any European programme; it is impossible to identify transmitter from your condenser readings.

R.W.A. Keith (Liverpool): (1) Stettin (236 m.) relaying dance music from Berlin; (2) Hanover (297 m.) relaying concert from Café Continental.

B. Brennan (Deal): (1) Stamboul (1,200 m.); (2) W.L. vague, but possibly Moscow giving University course.
Thankyou (Ashbourne): W.L. very wrong: possibly Budapest (555 m.). Other stations on near W.L. all giving dance music at that time, except Sevastopol (545 m.) which was relaying speech in Russian.
Turkey (Reading): There is no broadcasting station at Porth, Glam., and it is hardly likely that you would hear an amateur transmitter of that district. Although your estimated W.L. does not tally, it is possible that this was the Cork station. If you mean midday, Cork relays gramophone transmissions from Dublin; if you really mean midnight, the station may have been effecting tests.
Straight Four (Manchester): (5) Either Hamburg (394 m.) or Bremen (400 m.) which were both relaying an orchestral concert from the Alster Pavilion; (6) If W.L. correct, possibly Bilbao (EAJ11) 423 m.

Listener (York): Your W.L. is apparently wrong; both Langenberg (468 m.), relaying from the Rheinterrasse at Düsseldorf, and PTT Paris, relaying from Coliseum, were giving dance music. Most of the continental stations when giving English and American jazz songs announce the titles in English.
