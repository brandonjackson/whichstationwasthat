Cinnamon (Batley): (1) Scheveningen-Haven (Holland). (2) Langenberg did not advertise a relay, but as many experiments are being made with this high power transmitter it is quite possible that this was attempted.

Roses (Gloucester): Vienna.

A. D. (Douglas, I.O.M.): Cannot trace on this WL; the item was not advertised in any programme.

3CF/13SP (Wandsworth): Frankfort-on-Main.

Denton: (16) Leipzig (comic opera: Das Christelfein), (17) Milan, (18) Frankfort or Cassel relaying the former; your WL is vague.

H. J. (Walthamstow): (71) Yes, Zurich. (72) Barcelona (EAJ13).

(73) Hamburg. (74) Berlin. (75) rather vague, possibly Rome.

Mac 1: Frankfort-on-Main.

Mus (Seaford): Regret cannot trace, no morse lecture advertised in programmes on that WL.

Adeipi (W.10): Hamburg (first news bulletin).

Jansome (Birmingham): Apparently Oslo (Singer: Sjur Muldrup).

Rigby (Londonderry): Too vague, cannot trace.

Mercury (Manchester): Not advertised in programmes. The Muenster group frequently relay football matches; this may have been Langenberg (altered programme) taking such a relay from the Cologne Stadium.

Yorston (Bangor, Co. Down): Dortmund was from Hilversum.

S. F. H. (Edinburgh): WL (1) Langenberg relaying Dortmund; later Cologne. (2) Koenigswusterhausen.

Neutro (Fleet): Possibly a Swedish station, but lecture on Macbeth was not advertised.

Crundwell (Bexley Heath): Should not like to say that such a reception was impossible, but it is not of common occurrence. Items tally with KDKA transmission.

Harmony (Harlesden): Do not know of any station transmitting on a WL between Aberdeen or Brussels. Our experience of Langenberg on some evenings has been that whilst the transmission fades badly, the strength is less than that of most of the other German stations. It is not yet operating on full power.

Waves (Billingham): Langenberg.

E. T. (3690): Possibly Dublin, but details of the transmission are not advertised.

P. E. B. (West Ealing): Kiel relaying Hanover.

Gohon (Arbroath): Berlin.

Gouler (Dundalk): Naples.

Les Jardins (West Hartlepool): (5) Berlin, (6) Berne.

Lobster (Littlehampton): Manchester ("Ceremony of the Vacant Chair").

Elstree Six (1 and 2): Regret cannot trace from condenser readings.

Eltonian (Bury): WL apparently wrong; most probably Berlin.

Micky (Dundalk): Prague (opera: Madame Butterfly).

Searcher (Rothley): (1) Prague, (2) Leipzig.

Bee-Bee (Burnbrook): (1) San Sebastian, (2) Cannot trace a test (there is no German station on that.
