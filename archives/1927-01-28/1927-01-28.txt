Cinnamon (Batley): (1) Scheveningen-Haven (Holland). (2) Langenberg did not advertise a relay, but as many experiments are being made with this high power transmitter it is quite possible that this was attempted.

Harmony (Harlesden): Do not know of any station transmitting on a WL between Aberdeen or Brussels. Our experience of Langenberg on some evenings has been that whilst the transmission fades badly, the strength is less than that of most of the other German stations.
