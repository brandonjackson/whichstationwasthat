H. T. W. (Oaklands): A wireless telegraphy station sending out Vs (· · · —) as a call to another station; possibly calibration signals, but we cannot say from where you received this.
Twidler (Newington): Kalundborg, relaying from the Royal Theatre at Copenhagen. Folk songs and dances from the Faroe Islands.
Enthusiast (Littlehampton): You give no estimate of WL., but the only station that would tally with your details is Dublin, which gave the news and weather report at that time; also relayed by Cork on 400 m.
Mandoline (West Didsbury): WL. wrong; Madrid (EAJ7).
Interdyne (Pinner): Breslau. Esperanto lesson.
Solodyne Three (Cowes, I.W.): Kattowitz (Poland).
G. A. P. (S.W. 8): No, this was Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen. Chimes from the Town Hall at midnight (11 p.m. G.M.T.).
One More (Sheffield): Huizen (Holland), lunch-time music.
Helvetia (London): Yes, Berne. 6.30 to 7.10 p.m. G.M.T., reading by Rudolf Von Tavel.
Mayday (Doncaster): You state no time, but details would certainly tally with PTT Lyons.
Lost (Preston): Langenberg in both cases. On November 24 programme was slightly altered; on November 25, confirmed by the English dialogue between Mrs. Rueschekemp-Whitehead and Mr. Bennett.
Iona (Peckham Rye): Prague, relay of concert from the Narodium in Vinohrady.
H. A. J. (Fosse Farm): Kattowitz (Poland).
R. M. Bell (Carlisle): Your estimate of WL. is undoubtedly wrong, as there is no station dead on London; on that evening the only station advertised to work so late was Madrid (EAJ7).
Keady: Regret, cannot possibly tell you what this noise was.
H. M. S. (Felpham): Vienna, relaying Meyerbeer's Le Prophète from the Vienna Opera House. Details of cast were not published.
