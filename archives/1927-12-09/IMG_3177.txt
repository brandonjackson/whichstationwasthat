Derby): (1) Yes, Nürnberg, relaying concert from Munich. (2) Warsaw. Coupon from World-Radio must be sent with each enquiry.
Sedgewick: Possibly WJZ (Boundbrook), U.S.A.
Searcher (Rusholme): (30) Toulouse PTT relaying from Paris, concert broadcast by the École-Supérieure from the Salle des Fêtes des Sociétés Savantes, Paris.
Tim (W. 12): (1) Moscow Comintern (RDW). (2) If WL. correct, Leningrad. (3) If just above Vienna, Riga (Letland), but details would also tally with Munich.
Riopse (Ipswich): Cork, relaying Dublin. Symphony concert and choir from the Metropolitan Hall.
Crows Nest (Brighton): Frankfurt-on-Main. English lesson followed by operetta, Teresina (Strauss).
Rose Bud M.B.: (1) Langenberg, The Count of Luxembourg (Lehár). (2) Leipzig.
W. P. H. (Colchester): Vienna (Rosenhuegel), relay from Opera House of Meyerbeer’s Le Prophète (5 acts).
Geary (Westgate): (1) Berne (a lady announcer); (2) WL. is too indefinite, regret cannot trace.
R. D. (Queen’s Park W. Glasgow): Levard (Darvel): Regret cannot trace, as it is impossible to identify station heard without some estimate of WL., and condenser readings do not help.
Crows Nest (Brighton): Moscow, relaying dance music records. In the case of Scandinavian stations, the choruses of dance melodies are frequently sung in English.
Raudine (Hythe): Bruenn (gramophone records).
Counterpoise (St. Neots): Cannot possibly say on which WL. you received this.
J. D. (Portadown): Frankfurt-on-Main (gramophone records).
Puritan (Guildford): From the words heard, apparently a German service, but such transmissions were given at that time by Berlin, Koenigsberg, Frankfurt, Langenberg, Leipzig and Hamburg, and taken by their respective relays. We cannot possibly identify the individual transmitter heard.
G. R. (Ringwood): WGY (Schenectady).
Brython (Cardiff): (1) Yes, Aberdeen (Children’s Hour); (2) Leipzig. Lecture on the Tonic Sol-Fa.
Novice & Walver Copenhagen.: Afternoon concert.

St. Elma (Hull): Berne.
Listener (S. Wales): No, this was Huizen (Holland).
Anode (Stafford Park): L. W. H. (Bristol): Keen (Middlesbrough): Bearwood: (a) Frankfurt-on-Main (gramophone records) (b) Dortmund, relaying Langenberg.
