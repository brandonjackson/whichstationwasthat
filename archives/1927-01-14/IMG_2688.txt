and Galvo (Edgbaston): Mr. Arthur Burrows, speaking at Geneva; apparently received through Berne.  
Amateur WL: far too vague: cannot trace.  
Everyman 4 (Brixton): probably Manchester.  
Brun (Burnley): Many foreign stations relay transmissions from 5XX at odd times; it is seldom possible to trace transmitter, unless wavelength is fairly accurately estimated, as such relays are rarely advertised in the programmes.  
A.M.L. (Stockport): Cannot trace.  
Jolly Good (S.W.15): Manchester.  
Bogey (Hampstead): (a) Yes, KGO has been received on several occasions; (b) Tallies with Manchester, special transmission.  
Aperiodic Coupling (Castleknock): Surely Manchester.  
A.D.T.: Manchester.  
J.W.L./P.Z.: (1) Naples; (2) Rome on 449 m.  
F.S.G. (Eastbourne): Yes, Leningrad.  
Nighthawk (Bishop Auckland): (1) If not Dortmund cannot trace; (2) Cadiz (EAJ3).  
Yarn (Halifax): (1) see reply to Brun (Burnley); (2) Bordeaux-Lafayette; (3) too vague: possibly a relay of Stockholm.  
W.M. (Prestwich): Frankfort relaying dance music from Berlin.  
Paris-ite (St. Cloud, France): Manchester (“The Ceremony of the Vacant Chair”, special late transmission.  
3 Unidyne (Steppingley): (22) probably Leningrad (1155 m.); (23) Buda-Pesth; (24) Milan relaying Stockholm.  
P.P.V.2 (Camden Town): Manchester.  
Gec (Redditch): (1) Zurich; (2) Stettin relaying Berlin; (3) Breslau.  
Cantilever (Forest Hill): (11) W.L. (Boundbrook) 454 m.; (12) Scheveningen-Haven (Holland), new commercial wireless telephony station on 1950 m.; (13) Berne; (14) WTAM, Cleveland (Ohio) on 389.4 m.; (15) Cannot trace in last U.S.A. lists.  
Dixie 11 (Liverpool): Not a Spanish station. You heard the German National Anthem. If WL. correct, Bremen relaying Hamburg, but we are inclined to believe that you are receiving the Frankfort transmission.  
Lugar (Sheffield): Prague (Call: “Allo! Praha.”).  
Green (Knighton): Langenberg effecting a test relay of chimes from Cologne Cathedral.  
Brookfield (Stoke-on-Trent): Was not this Daventry?  
Hill (Portsmouth): Cannot trace transmitter from details of coils; some estimated WL. must be given.  
Puzzled Midget (Crosby): Apparently U.S.A. station, but there are very many on this W.L. ; we could not possibly confirm which station you received; possibly WJAS, Pittsburg.  
Taffy (Flintshire): (2) Langenberg relaying chimes from Cologne Cathedral.  
Lex (Southampton): WL. wrong; this was Frankfort-on-Main.  
Kemp (Hampton): Zurich is the only station on that wave of which we know so late as time stated.
