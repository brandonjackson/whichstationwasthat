Sure, here's the transcription:

and Galvo (Edgbaston): Mr. Arthur Burrows, speaking at Geneva; apparently received through Berne. Amateur WL. far too vague: cannot trace. Everyman 4 (Brixton) and Manchester. Brun (Burnley): Many foreign stations relay transmissions from 5XX at odd times; it is seldom possible to trace transmitter, unless wavelength is fairly accurately estimated, as such relays are rarely advertised in the programmes. A.M.L. (Stockport): Cannot trace. Jolly Good (S.W.15): Manchester. Bogey (Hampstead): (a) Yes, KGO has been received on several occasions; (b) Tallies with Manchester, special transmission. Aperiodic Coupling (Castlenock): Surely Manchester. A.D.T.: Manchester. J.W.L./P.Z.: (1) Naples; (2) Rome on 449 m. F.S.G. (Eastbourne): Yes, Leningrad. Nighthawk (Bishop Auckland): If not Dortmund cannot trace; (2) Cadiz (EAJ3). Yarn (Halifax): (1) see reply to Brun (Burnley); (2) Bordeaux-Lafayette3 too vague; possibly a relay of Stockholm. W.M. (Prestwich): Frankfort relaying dance music from Berlin. Paris-ite (St. Cloud, France): Manchester (“The Ceremony of the Vacant Chair”, special late transmission. 3 Unidyne (Steppingley): (22) Malmo relay Stockholm (1165 m.); (23) Buda-Pesth; (24) London relaying Manchester; (25) R.C.A.; (26) Prague relaying Manchester. Gec. (Redditch): (1) Zurich; (2) Stettin relaying Berlin; (3) Breslau. Cantilever (Forest Hill.): (11) WL (Boundbrook) 454 m.; (12) Scheveningen-Haven (Holland), new commercial wireless telephony station on 1950 m.; (13) Berne; (14) WTAM, Cleveland (Ohio) on 389.4 m.; (15) Cannot trace in last U.S.A. lists. Dixie II (Liverpool): Not a Spanish station. You heard the German National Anthem. If WL. correct, Bremen relaying Hamburg, but we are inclined to believe that you are receiving the Frankfort transmission. Luggar (Sheffield): Prague (Call: “Allo! Praha.”) Green (Knighton): Langenberg effecting a test relay of chimes from Cologne Cathedral. Brookfield (Stoke-on-Trent): Was not this Daventry? Hill (Portsmouth): Cannot trace transmitter from details of coils; some estimated WL. must be given. Puzzled Midget (Crosby): Apparently U.S.A. station, but there are very many on this WL.; we could not possibly confirm which station you received; possibly WJAS, Pittsburgh. Taffy (Flintshire): (2) Langenberg relaying chimes from Cologne Cathedral. Lex (Southampton): WL. wrong; this was Frankfort-on-Main. Kemp (Hampden): Zurich is the only station that has been received for some weeks so late as time stated. No details of this transmission.
