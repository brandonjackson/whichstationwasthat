Searcher (Teignmouth): Malmo relaying from Concert Hall at Stockholm.
Jeff (London): Barcelona (EAJ1).
Anglo-American Six (Southport): (1) Zurich, (2) San Sebastian.
Gee (Swinton): Your WL. is apparently wrong; moreover without details as to dates and times, it is impossible to trace a transmission.
Onondaga (Bristol): (1) If your WL. is correct, an amateur transmission, but believe that it was about 56 m., in which case you heard the Berlin shortwave station, (2) Beziers has closed down, (3) amateurs relaying in broadcast transmissions.

Novice (S.E. 22): (1) Obviously a German station but estimation of WL. far too vague to trace transmitter, (2) WL. is also too vague, presumably a French station.
Baffled (Geneva): Presumably E.I, Paris on high power, testing, (2) apparently a new French station at La Bourboule, on the banks of the Dordogne (Département-Puy-de-Dome). In reply to observer's letter, so far as our reports go, Bratislava (Pressburg) is still operating on 300 m. and the interference noticed on the British and German stations was probably caused by Barcelona (EAJ1).
The Old Man (Eastbourne):
