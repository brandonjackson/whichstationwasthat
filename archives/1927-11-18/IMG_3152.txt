A. D. F. A. (Leicester): This is the new station at Colma (Italy) possibly relaying Milan.

Trebor (Glasgow): Your estimate of WL. is very vague, but possibly Frankfurt-on-Main (gramophone records).

A. P. (Derby), Saga Road (Southport): Kalundborg, relaying dance music from the Restaurant Nimb at Copenhagen.

C. H. O. (Kendal): Copenhagen, Radio Ball (relaying dance music from the Restaurant Nimb until 1 a.m. G.M.T.).

2 Valver (Kidderminster): Muenster, relaying English lesson from Cologne via Langenberg.

Maclean (Prestbury): WL. surely wrong, details would tally with Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen (Radio Ball).

Night Hawk (Accrington): WL. very vague, but possibly Barcelona (EAJ1) relaying Madrid (EAJ7). A coupon must be sent with each inquiry.

R. Minns (Gt. Yarmouth): Not advertised in programme, but according to other reports, details would point to Kalundborg.

Earlybird (Reading): It is very difficult to trace a relayed transmission; possibly Stockholm, through one of the smaller transmitters.

Puzzled (Herne Bay): Can trace one French station on or about that WL. giving gramophone records at that time. Not PTT Lille.

E. M. (Antwerp): Yes, Zürich.

H. Williamson (Edinburgh): Moscow Comintern (RDW).

Neutrodyne (Leeds): (1) Frankfurt-on-Main, (2) Seville (EAJ17), relaying Madrid (EAJ7), (3) Berlin (Witzleben). Talk: “What do we laugh at?” 

Kemyst (Cheshire): Cannot trace, probably transmission of a gramophone record.
