H. W. A. C (Bexhill-on-Sea): Langenberg, relaying concert from the Hotel zur Post at Elberfeld.

J. W. Field (Catford): Milan. This station has changed wavelengths with Breslau, i.e., the former is now on 315.8 m. and the latter on 322.6 m.

Dog: (1) Nuremberg, relaying Munich. See programme for latter station in World-Radio; (2) Possibly the new PTT station at Rennes, testing on about 320 m.; (3) Prague.

Newton: Langenberg, relaying dance music from Cologne until 1 a.m. Aug. 28.

Ardara (Co. Donegal): No Continental station on or about your estimated WL, advertised a relay of Daventry on that date, but it is quite possible that this was Sorö (now Kalundborg), which often relays 5XX without previous warning.

Stuart (Guildford): Norddeich (Germany) 1,780 m. News and weather reports only.

V. (Darlington): Yes, Moscow (Comintern). Possibly a test, as this station, according to programmes, closed down about 10 p.m.

B. S. T. Mercy (York): (1) If French, Juan-les-Pins; (2) Yes, possibly Salamanca, but cannot confirm as no programmes are available; there is also Cadiz (EAJ3) on 400 m., which gives an experimental concert at midnight.

Qui-est-ce-Que?: Hilversum. Evensong, followed by news.

F. Fisher (Woodley): Nuremberg (chamber music).

Polkyth Two (Cornwall): PTT Marseilles. Station above giving the London programme was Newcastle.

Tocsin (Sheffield): (1) Bremen, relaying a concert from the Café Walhoff at Hamburg until midnight; (2) If your estimated WL is correct, this was Hilversum, apparently working later than advertised in programme.

R. (Port Sunlight): Regret, cannot trace, as it is impossible to estimate WL. from your condenser readings. Motala, Koenigswusterhausen, Boden, and Sorö were all giving dance music at that time.

Sparkes-Madge: Daventry (5XX) relaying concert from the Kursaal at Ostend. Not advertised in programmes.

Whersit (Chiswick): Madrid (EAJ7). Children’s Hour, followed by concert by the station orchestra.

Power Valve Buster (Brighton): (1) Your details are very vague, but would tally with Koenigsberg; (2) Barcelona (EAJ1).

Blint-Bony: Yes, Daventry (5XX) relaying concert from the Kursaal at Ostend. Not advertised in programmes.

English Listener in Paris: Budapest, relaying a concert of Hungarian music from the Zoological Gardens.

Safety 3 (Plumstead): (1) Probably San Sebastian, but cannot confirm as no programmes are available; (2) PTT Marseilles.
