(4) Possibly Cadiz (EAJ3).
Ambrose (Bexhill-on-Sea): (1) Yes, Moscow (RDW), but not an outside relay; (2) Moscow (RDW) transmits on every evening of the week; (3) No, you are not mistaken, this was PTT Paris (afternoon concert).
BM/BD30: Cadiz (EAJ3); Experimental concert.
E. H. B. (Derby): The three stations you hear must-all be German, as the National Anthem for that country is played before the tune of the old Austrian hymn, of which the music is by Haydn.
