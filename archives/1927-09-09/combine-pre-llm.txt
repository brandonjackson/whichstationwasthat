H. W. A. C (Bexhill-on-Sea): Langenberg, relaying concert from the Hotel zur Post at Elberfeld.
J. W. Field (Catford): Milan. This station has changed wavelengths with Breslau, i.e., the former is now on 315.8 m. and the latter on 322.6 m.
Dog: (1) Nuremberg, relaying Munich. See programme for latter station in World-Radio; (2) Possibly the new PTT station at Rennes, testing on about 320 m.; (3) Prague.
Newton: Langenberg, relaying dance music from Cologne until 1 a.m. Aug. 28.
Ardara (Co. Donegal): No Continental station on or about your estimated WL, advertised a relay of Daventry on that date, but it is quite possible that this was Sorö (now Kalundborg), which often relays 5XX without previous warning.
Stuart (Guildford): Norddeich (Germany) 1,780 m. News and weather reports only.
V. (Darlington): Yes, Moscow (Comintern). Possibly a test, as this station, according to programmes, closed down about 10 p.m.
B. S. T. Mercy (York): (1) If French, Juan-les-Pins; (2) Yes, possibly Salamanca, but cannot confirm as no programmes are available; there is also Cadiz (EAJ3) on 400 m., which gives an experimental concert at midnight.
Qui-est-ce-Que?: Hilversum. Evensong, followed by news.
F. Fisher (Woodley): Nuremberg (chamber music).
Polkyth Two (Cornwall): PTT Marseilles. Station above giving the London programme was Newcastle.
Tocsin (Sheffield): (1) Bremen, relaying a concert from the Café Walhoff at Hamburg until midnight; (2) If your estimated WL is correct, this was Hilversum, apparently working later than advertised in programme.
R. (Port Sunlight): Regret, cannot trace, as it is impossible to estimate WL. from your condenser readings. Motala, Koenigswusterhausen, Boden, and Sorö were all giving dance music at that time.
Sparkes-Madge: Daventry (5XX) relaying concert from the Kursaal at Ostend. Not advertised in programmes.
Whersit (Chiswick): Madrid (EAJ7). Children’s Hour, followed by concert by the station orchestra.
Power Valve Buster (Brighton): (1) Your details are very vague, but would tally with Koenigsberg; (2) Barcelona (EAJ1).
Blint-Bony: Yes, Daventry (5XX) relaying concert from the Kursaal at Ostend. Not advertised in programmes.
English Listener in Paris: Budapest, relaying a concert of Hungarian music from the Zoological Gardens.
Safety 3 (Plumstead): (1) Probably San Sebastian, but cannot                       
confirm as no programmes are available; (2) PTT Marseilles                       
(own concert).  Alaskan (Cheshire): Daventry (5XX)                       
relaying concert from the Kursaal at Ostend.  Not advertised                       
in programmes.  2 Valve Gets ’Em (South Hackney): (1)                       
Either Langenberg or Berlin (Witzleben); both stations were                       
giving dance music at that time; (2) Rather vague, but possibly                       
Stuttgart.  G. R. C. 17 (Taunton): Milan.  This station has                       
changed W.L. with Breslau, and is now on 315.8 m.                       
Lansdown (Bath): Radio Toulouse (see detailed programme                       
in World Radio).  It is Stuttgart that gives three different                       
notes as interval signal: C, D, G, produced by oscillating                       
valves.  C. H. L. Askham (Liverpool): (1) What do you mean                       
by “W.L. slightly higher than GW”?; (2) Oslo.  Shipy                       
(York): (1) Milan, (2) Stockholm, (3) Rather vague, but ifWL. correct Cassel, relaying dance music from Frankfort, but Dresden on 275.2 m. was also relaying dance music from Leipzig.
(4) Possibly Cadiz (EAJ3).
Ambrose (Bexhill-on-Sea): (1) Yes, Moscow (RDW), but not an outside relay; (2) Moscow (RDW) transmits on every evening of the week; (3) No, you are not mistaken, this was PTT Paris (afternoon concert).
BM/BD30: Cadiz (EAJ3); Experimental concert.
E. H. B. (Derby): The three stations you hear must-all be German, as the National Anthem for that country is played before the tune of the old Austrian hymn, of which the music is by Haydn.
Mullard 4: Berlin (Witzleben). Selections from the operettas of Lehár and Millocker. See programme in World-Radio.
4 Valver (Coventry): Scheveningen-Haven, Holland (1,950 m.). Stock Exchange quotations and market prices, etc., only.
The Good Two (Brighton): (1) Stuttgart; (2) Rather vague, but possibly PTT Lyons. There is a new station at Kharkov (Russia) working daily from 7 p.m. on 487 m.; (3) Frankfort-on-Main, also relayed by Cassel. For queries 1 and 3 see programme in World-Radio.
Legg (Walsall): (1) If German, Hamburg, relaying concert from the Café Wallhof. Closed down at midnight; (3) Milan; (4) Frankfort-on-Main.
Portsmouth: (1) Possibly Norrkoeping, relaying Stockholm; (2) Posgrund, relaying from the Hotel Bristol at Oslo.
H. T. B. (Leamington Spa): Nevabefloa (Birkenhead).
2 Valver (Belfast): All details would point to a test by the new 7 kw. station at Milan.
Searcher (Ashford, Kent): Although not advertised we believe this to have been Hilversum.
Three Valve-Dual (Rochdale): Station giving song recital was possibly Basle; cannot trace any transmitter giving orchestral concert on that WL.
Chips (Kettering): Rome relaying opera Il Trovatore from an outside theatre.
S. S. 2 (Gosforth): Moscow Komintern station on 1,450 metres.
Four Valver (Henbury, Bristol): Frankfort relaying from the “Tanzhause” at Cassel.
