File A last line: previous warning. Stuart (Guildford): Norddeich (Germany), 1,780 m. News and weather reports only. 3 V. (Darlington): Yes, Moscow (Comintern). Possibly a test, as this station, according to programmes, closed down about 10 p.m. B. S. T. Mercy (York): (1) If French, Juan-les-Pins; (2) Yes, possibly Salamanca, but cannot confirm as no programmes are available; there is also Cadiz (EAJ3) on 400 m, which gives an experimental concert at midnight. Qui-est-ce-Que?: Hilversum. Evensong, followed by news. F. Fisher (Woodley): Nuremberg (chamber music). Polkyth Two (Cornwall): PTT Marseilles. Station above giving the London programme was Newcastle. Tocsin (Sheffield): (1) Bremen, relaying a concert from the Café Wallhof at Hamburg until midnight; (2) If your estimated WL. is correct, this was Hilversum, apparently working later than advertised in programme. R. (Port Sunlight): Regret, cannot trace, as it is impossible to estimate WL. from your condenser readings. Motala, Koenigsusterhausen, Boden, and Sorö were all giving dance music at that time. Sparkes-Madge: Daventry (5XX) relaying concert from the Kursaal at Ostend. Not advertised in programmes. Wersit (Chiswick): Madrid (EAJ7). Children’s Hour, followed by concert by the station orchestra. Power Valve Buster (Brighton): (1) Your details are very vague, but would tally with Koenigsberg or Barcelona (EAJ13). Blint-Bonny: Yes, Daventry (5XX) relaying concert from the Kursaal at Ostend. Not advertised in programmes. English Listener in Paris: Budapest, relaying a concert of Hungarian music from the Zoological Gardens. Safety 3 (Plumstead): (1) Probably San Sebastian, but cannot confirm as no programmes are available; (2) PTT Marseilles (own concert). Alaskan (Cheshire): Daventry (5XX) relaying concert from the Kursaal at Ostend. Not advertised in programmes. 2 Valve Gets 'Em (South Hackney): (1) Either Langenberg or Berlin (Witzleben); both stations were giving dance music at that time; (2) Rather vague, but possibly Stuttgart. G. R. C. 17 (Taunton): Milan. This station has changed WL. with Breslau, and is now on 315.8 m. Lansdown (Bath): Radio Toulouse (see detailed programme in World Radio). It is Stuttgart that gives three different notes as interval signal: C, D, G, produced by oscillating valves. C. H. L. Askham (Liverpool): (1) What do you mean by “WL. slightly higher than GW”?; (2) Oslo. Shipy (York): (1) Milan, (2) Stockholm, (3) Rather vague, but if.
