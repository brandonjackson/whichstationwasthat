Elbuscador (Frome): Yes, Vienna (517.2 m.). The Prater, in Song and Music, followed by a concert of light music. This station was advertised to close down at midnight, not 11.30 p.m.

Mirador (Woodford Green): Moscow (RDW), 1,450 m.

Quidst (Leicester): Sorö relaying Church Service from the Elias Church at Copenhagen.

Siegfried (Wylde Green): Yes, believe this to be Rome, although item heard was not advertised in programmes. There is also Bilbao (EAJ9) on 438 m., but no programmes available.

Tweed (Durham Down): This was a B.B.C. relay from Ostend, 3-3.30 p.m. not advertised in programmes.

Wonderful Three (Barum): Koenigswusterhausen relaying morning concert from Berlin. Songs and recitations.

3 Valve (Surbiton): This was Hilversum, as the items you heard were all advertised in the afternoon programme, given by that station, from 12.50 to 1.50 p.m.

Anglais (South Lincs.): If your estimated W.L. is correct, would tally with Kovno, but cannot confirm, as no programmes are available.

Wessex (Paignton): This was Hilversum. From 12.50 to 1.50 p.m. this station relayed a concert of music from the Palace Hotel at Scheveningen. Coupon must be sent with each inquiry.

8-Valve Super Het (Works): Either Warsaw or Basle; both stations are giving out an identical relay of a concert.

Lord Mains Hall Farm: From 3 to 3.30 p.m. on August 14 the B.B.C. relayed, through Daventry, an organ recital from Ostend. Not advertised in programmes.

Ambrose (Bexhill-on-Sea): Yes, this was Rome. Your items tally with advertised programme.

XIT (Taunton): Possibly Radio Beziers, which was giving a concert at that time.

Weightonian: Cork. Own concert; relayed by Dublin on 319 m.

Vet (Liverpool): This would appear to be Barcelona (EAJ1) on 344.8 m., but these outside relays of operas are not always advertised in programmes.

Mack (Upton Manor): On August 14, from 3 to 3.30 p.m. the B.B.C. relayed, through Daventry, an organ recital from Ostend. Not advertised in programmes.

J. M. M. (Maryhill): Are you sure of your W.L.? We can trace no Continental programme, on or about 380 m., which would tally with the details you give. Possibly this might be Radio Toulouse, which was giving a concert in the studio at about that time, but no selections for the harp were advertised.

O.V. 2 (Enfield): Rome; Concert of light music, (1) Koenigswusterhausen; (2) Hamburg; (3) Kiel. tenor and soprano solos.

Rumboy (Ballymoney): Berlin, (1) Koenigswusterhausen (1,250 m.) relaying dance music from Berlin, (2) Hamburg. This station is also relayed by Hanover on 297 m., and Kiel on 254.2 m.

Roma Davies (Westcliff-on-Sea): Regret, cannot trace, as your details are much too vague, and it is impossible to say which station you heard, without some estimate of W.L. Coupon from World Radio was not sent with each inquiry.
