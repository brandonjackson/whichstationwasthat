Quatre V (Pontypool): Motala, relaying Stockholm.

Figg (Dover): Kalundborg relaying dance music from the Restaurant Nimb at Copenhagen. At midnight (11 p.m. G.M.T.), chimes relayed from the Town Hall.

Naturwissenschaft (Leicester): (1) Bilbao (EAJ9) relaying Seville (EAJ5). These are both Union Radio stations; (2) yes, PTT Lille; (3) Posen, at 7.10-9.45 p.m. a relay of a military concert from the University, followed by a relay of dance music from the Restaurant Carlton.

Nota Bene (Shipley): Your estimate of W.L. is surely wrong; details would tally with Warsaw, which was relaying a concert for piano and orchestra from the Philharmonic Hall in that city.

Drummer (Malthy): (1) Possibly Malmö, which was relaying a legal talk from Göteborg at that time; (2) Bordeaux Lafayette; (3) yes, Koenigsberg; (4) Barcelona (EAJ1). Gramophone records of Beethoven's 5th Symphony (5) yes, the London Stand-by transmitter works on the same W.L. as 2LO; (6) yes, Koenigswusterhausen (Press) on 2,525 and 2,900 m.; (7) Warsaw (a lady announcer).

Silver Star (Forest Gate): (1) Warsaw, relaying a concert for piano and orchestra from the Philharmonic Hall in that city; (2) Langenberg, but it is impossible to trace the more stations you heard.

Home Made (Newcastle): Your details are too vague; regret, this was a relay of Langenberg, either Münster or Dortmund; (2) if W.L. correct, Hanover, relaying from the Café Continental; (3) Frankfurt (News followed by English programme); (4) details very vague, but possibly Berne; (5) Hamburg (English programme); (6) possibly Bremen, relaying Hamburg (English programme); (7) details would tally with Karlstad, relaying Stockholm (English programme); (8) Graz, relaying Vienna (English programme); (9) Leipzig; (10) possibly Breslau (closing down); (11) apparently amateur transmitter; (12) Stettin, relaying dance music from Berlin.

Blue Vinney (Dorset): (1) Oslo (a scene from Macbeth); (2) possibly Barcelona (EAJ13); (3) Leipzig.

Rierstroke (Barnstaple): Possibly British amateur, 2NM (Caterham, Surrey) on 23 m.

S. W. S. W. (Smethwick): Can trace no station on or about 470 m. which was giving The Mastersingers at that time; Rome advertised Carmen at 7.40 p.m.; it is quite possible that the opera was changed.

Scribbler (Maidstone): Vienna (Rosenhuegel) English programme.

Nobby Clarke (Maidenhead): (1) Madrid (EAJ7); (2) Prague.

N. 567321 (Hull): You appear to have heard Kalundborg (Denmark) testing at that time.

Leather (Wandsworth): (1) We do not know of any Spanish or Italian station on that W.L.; would tally with either Warsaw or Motala, as these stations do not always close down to adver-
