A. J. Peck (Enfield): Hilversum (new gramophone records of dance music).

B.M./B./3./3.S.D. (Blackheath): Yes, Warsaw (children’s afternoon concert).

B.A.F.A. (S.W.12): (1) Frankfurt, relaying Cassel (a lady announcer); (2) Details very vague, but possibly Barcelona (EAJ13).

C. R. H. (Cheshire): Dortmund, relaying Langenberg.

QSL (Wilmslow): (1) Yes, Madrid (EAJ7); (2) Milan, relaying opera from the Theatre dal Verme; (3) PTT Lyons, relaying PTT Paris (dance music from the Coliseum, Paris); (4) your estimate of WL. is surely wrong; details would tally with Frankfurt, which was relaying dance music from a cabaret at that time. Interval signal, ticking of metronome; (5) if Spanish, possibly Seville (EAJ5) about 357 m.; (6) Barcelona (EAJ1); (7) Münster, relaying via Langenberg, an orchestral concert from Cologne; (8) yes, Gleitwitz, but not a language lesson; (9) Stettin; (10) details too vague; regret, cannot trace; (11) apparently these were relays of the Stockholm Children’s Hour. If your estimate of wavelengths for Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are approximately correct, we take it that they were Halmstad, Gaefe, Kristinelhamn, Jönköping and Ornskoldsvik; (16) apparently Frankfurt-on-Main (gramophone records); (17) Langenberg (closing down).

Radio Roma (Cheshire): (1) Cracow, relaying concert from Warsaw (lady announcer); (2) Moscow-Comintern (RDW); (3) Scheveningen-Haven, Holland (1,950 m.) commercial intelligence, etc.

Tim (W.2): Motala, relaying Stockholm (news, etc).

323 (S.W.32): (1) Glasgow, relaying Edinburgh. Church Service from St. Cuthbert’s Parish Church. Preacher: Rev. A. F. Witham. This was also taken by Aberdeen (500 m). Ginger (Co. Louth, Ireland): WL. wrong; this was Kalundborg (1,153.8 m.) relaying Copenhagen.

U.S.A. (Southport): 2KS, amateur transmitter, Preston (Lancashire).

Two Valver (Kidderminster): Hilversum (new gramophone records).

Kilenoway: (1) Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen. Soprano, Julie Winding; (2) yes, Hilversum (new gramophone records).

4 Valver (Ystlowe): Impossible to trace, as nearly all the German stations close down with a few bars played from the anthem.

Thelma (Birmingham): Frankfurt, relaying late concert from Cassel (lady announcer).

Searcher (Rusholme): (1) Warsaw; (2) if WL. correct, Prague; (3) possibly Madrid (EAJ7) relaying Barcelona (EAJ1); (4) Bordeaux-La-fayette; (5) if WL. correct, Madrid (EAJ7). Variety concert; (6) Barcelona (EAJ1) relaying Madrid (EAJ7); (7) regret, cannot trace.
