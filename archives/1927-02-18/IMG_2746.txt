E. (Warwick): Vienna (interval signal).
R. M. K. (Edinburgh): This was Madrid (EAJ7).
Moonbeam (Wickford): Berne (Switzerland) on 411 m.
H. A. Bromige (Hornsey): Programme tallies with Brunn.
Aoa-Tea-Roa: Cadiz (EAJ3).
Baco (Belfast): You do not say whether a.m. or p.m., and details are too vague.
Padagra Alandene: (1) Possibly WJZ (Cleveland), (2) WJZ (Boundbrook), (3) KDKA (East Pittsburgh), (4) possibly WORD (Batavia).
J. Gardner (Westcliff-on-Sea): Kiel, relaying Hamburg (news bulletin, etc., gramophone records during intervals).
Edward Westrope: You give no idea of WL. When your condenser marked 150, WL was apparently higher than London; about 450 m.
Scrutator: On the other hand, if you were tuned in at about 300 m., it is possible that you heard Dundee, which gave a variety programme until 11 p.m. and later dance music from Glasgow.
A. Daniel: Warsaw.
Scrutator: Would tally with Koenigswusterhausen short-wave transmitter, relaying Berlin programmes.
1st Terminal: Langenberg, relaying dance music from Caf√© Korso, Dortmund.
2 Valver (Leicester): No coupon sent.
Stredwick (St. Leonards-on-Sea): Regret, cannot trace your description of WL.
Omaha (Port Talbot): Can trace no musical transmission at that time in the neighbourhood of 2,350 m.; possibly Kovno on 2,000 m.
S. H. Holt (Kensington): (1) Possibly Radio Vitus (Paris), (2) would tally with PTT, Marseilles, relay of Veronique from the Trianon Lyrique Theatre, Paris, (3) Barcelona (EAJ1), relaying opera from Teatro del Liceco.
World-wide Listener: Your letter has been handed on to the Technical Department.
Salmon (Welling): Apparently a test, probably, Radio-Paris before the mid-day transmission.
Appleby (Newcastle-on-Tyne): No coupon enclosed.
F. B. H. (Smethwick): No coupon enclosed.
May (Thurnham): Your letter has been handed to the Editor.
A.J. S. (Nottingham): There is no Dutch station on that WL, possibly a Hamburg transmission (concert of dialect songs and recitations).
Raine (Cottingham-Hull): Without doubt a relay of these stations; you may have picked up Bilbao (EAJ11) which makes a feature of these transmissions throughout the evening programme.
Arabian Nights: (16) Malmoe relaying Stockholm (Dance music from the Grand Hotel Royal).
Two-Valves (Thurnham): (3) a harmonic, yes, a harmonic of Croydon (900 m.), (1) Langenberg (Cologne Carnival).
