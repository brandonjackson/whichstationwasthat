Sammy (Midlothian): There is no official German broadcasting station below 721 m. (Muenster). Stettin is the only station on a low W.L. which might suit your programmes. This may have been a relay of another foreign station.  
Condenser: Possibly Bergen.  
Radio Maniac (Nuneaton): Possibly Barcelona (EAJ13).  
S. T. C. B./4V: (h) Moscow (RDW), (i) Munich (from the Town Hall), (j) Brunn (Second Act of La Traviata (Verdi) from National Theatre), (k) Sundsvall (545 m.) relaying Stockholm, (l) Kovno, (m) Copenhagen, (n) PTT, Lyons.

R. J. D. (Tamworth): Apparently Breslau.

E. B. (Wisbech): Without some idea of WL. it is impossible to give you a satisfactory reply, but the station as proved by the call was a Spanish one, and possibly Madrid (EAJ7).  
Cossaerial (Aintree): WGY (Schenectady).  
C. G. Norton (Langport): No, more probably Helsingfors, which lies exactly between these two stations.  
R. A. Miller: WL. wrong, tallies with Berlin programme.  
Lynwood: Your query is vague. Barcelona (EAJ1) frequently takes a late transmission of opera from el Liceo in that city; Naples also on occasions gives a late jazz transmission.  
Wireless Maniac: WL. wrong, Langenberg. Celebrations in commemoration of T. A. Edison's eightieth birthday. First phonograph record: "Mary Had a Little Lamb."  
W. G. H. (Reading): Langenberg. Celebrations in commemoration of T. A. Edison's eightieth birthday. First phonographic record: "Mary Had a Little Lamb."

Winfarthing: (1) Prague, (2) Vienna.

Savoy Three (Belfast): (120) cannot trace, (170) not in programmes, possibly Gothenberg, relay of Stockholm.  
Denton: (26) possibly Riga, on that WL., no programmes published, (27) details are very vague, rather point to an aircraft transmission.  
E. A. Wells (1): Too vague; U.S.A. station, (2) Marseilles, PTT.  
Lichfieldian (Staffs.): (75) Possibly Barcelona (EAJ13), (77) rather vague, details point to Bourn, relaying Prague, (78) believe Bilbao (EAJ9), no programmes published, (79) Frankfort-on-Main.

L. C. M.: (4) Marseilles, PTT, (5) yes, Sorø, relaying Copenhagen.  
Taylor (Wharton, N.J., U.S.A.): Could not be the London station if you heard it at 12.45 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (this would be 6.45 a.m. here). Was not this 3LO Melbourne?  
H. W. Wanderer (Southampton): (1) Cannot trace. The Stockholm station was giving an English lesson at 6.40 p.m. W.  
Terminal Tim: (1) Surely not on that WL.—Dublin, (2) Petit Parisien (Paris); announcements are made in both French and English, (3) cannot trace.

W. E. A. 4 (Reading): We think you will find that is the Vienna metronome interval signal.  
Gilbafflex 3: (1) Possibly WPG (Atlantic City) on 299.8 m., (2) would tally as to time with WLW (Cincinnati (5 kw.)).

J. Gardner (Westcliff-on-Sea): Kiel, relaying Hamburg (news bulletin, etc., gramophone records during intervals).  
Edward Westrope: You give no idea of WL. When your condenser marked 150, WL was apparently higher than London; about 450 m.  
Scrutator: On the other hand, if you were tuned in at about 300 m., it is possible that you heard Dundee, which gave a variety programme until 11 p.m. and later dance music from Glasgow.

May (Thurnham): Your letter has been handed to the Editor.  
A.J. S. (Nottingham): There is no Dutch station on that WL, possibly a Hamburg transmission (concert of dialect songs and recitations).

Whitey (Oxford): All stations reverted to London at that time. Why not WGY (Schenectady) direct? The transmissions are frequently received on this side.
