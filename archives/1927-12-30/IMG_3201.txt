11–11.30 p.m. G.M.T. dance music relayed from Berlin.
11.30–12 p.m. G.M.T. relay of London, and time signal from Big Ben, followed by a relay of dance music from the Restaurant Nimb at Copenhagen.
Bibliophile (Enfield): PTT Paris. Victor Hugo Festival relayed from the Trocadero Theatre.
Nomad (Peterborough): Huizen (Holland).
Castle (Hickstead): Yes, without doubt this was Frankfurt (interval signal: metronome). On December 3 no outside relay of a match was advertised, but your details tally with the programme published for December 9, i.e., Grossstadtluft, a farce by Blumenthal and Kadelburg.
G. T. Gough (Seven Kings): PTT Lyons relaying concert from the Théâtre Mogador at Paris.
J. W. B. (Malta): (1) British amateur, (Surrey); call - 2NM, (2) yes, 5SW (Chelmsford), (3) cannot trace; apparently either French or Italian.
Wynchcroft (Winchmore Hill): (1) Items do not tally with any French programme, but quite possibly Radio-Sud-Ouest, Bordeaux, (2) a harmonic of Koenigswusterhausen (Press) on 2,525 m., (3) cannot trace Morse transmissions, but this would appear to be a direction-finding station.
Victor (Hull): W.L. surely wrong - details tally with PTT Paris' Victor Hugo Festival relayed from the Trocadero Theatre.
A. L. Rogers (Stratford): Apparently an English station, but the only one giving gramophone records at that time was Sheffield; your wavelengths are apparently wrong; regret, cannot trace first station.
Tambour (Walthamstow): Huizen (Holland). Lunch time music.
DSB.M.L. (Morley): Your estimate of WL is much too vague, regret, cannot trace.
A. J. T. (Ilford): You do not say if below or above Koenigswusterhausen, but this was apparently either Motala (Sweden) or Kalundborg (Denmark) testing. (Gramophone records.)
E. Ward (Failsworth): Frankfurt-am-Main. The early morning broadcast of physical exercises. Gramophone records in the intervals.
Marcophone (Clapham Junction): (1) Yes, Madrid (EAJ7), (2) San Sebastian (EAJ8) and Seville (EAJ5), (3) Yes, Stuttgart.
White Hayes L.W.: The short-wave transmitter of Radio LL, Paris, on 61 metres.
Straight L (Bradford): Leningrad (News).
Harold W. Hicks (Norfolk): Yes, Moscow Comintern (RDW).
Era (Tunbridge Wells): (1) Yes, Posen, (2) yes, Kattowitz.
E. C. T. (Oldcorn): Cannot trace transmission on 30 m.; apparently amateur (gramophone records). 2NM, amateur, call sign (Surrey) on 32 m.
N. J. G. (Portsmouth): Possibly Kharkov (Narkompotchetel).
F. B. P. (Hove): (1) Possibly Antwerp.
