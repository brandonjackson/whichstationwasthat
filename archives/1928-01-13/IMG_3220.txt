Wright (Canombury): Yes, Frankfurt-on-Main relayed WGY (Schenectady); also taken by most of the other German stations. Herga (Norwich): Something radically wrong with your coils, for the Thursday programme from the Winter Garden Cabaret at Kiel was broadcast by that station, and was also relayed by Hamburg. The English lesson was taken by the entire Hamburg group, again including Kiel. On January 1, programme was also taken by Hamburg, Hanover and Kiel. In our opinion the transmissions were heard from Hamburg, and not on 760 kc. Are you not using the low
