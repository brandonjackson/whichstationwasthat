Fragment: details would tally with Radio LL, Paris.

Nitram (Birmingham): Cologne.

W. E. Walker (Sunderland): WGY (Schenectady) was relayed by Frankfurt-on-Main, and passed on, we believe, to most of the other German stations; you apparently heard this through Munich.

Enquirer (Busby): Copenhagen, working later than advertised in programmes.

M. Procter (S.E.1): You give no estimate of WL, but possibly Kalundborg relaying Copenhagen.

Listen (Moseley): If WL, approximately correct, WPG (Atlantic City).

H. Wilson (East Sheen): An amateur transmission but cannot trace as you give no call sign.

Bondi (Penegoes): Seeing reference to The Magic Flute (Mozart), the nearest French station to your estimate of WL, you would hear at any great strength is Lille, relaying from the Coliseum at Paris; (3) WL wrong, Berlin; also taken by Stettin, Koenigsusterhausen, Leipzig and Dresden.

L. D. (Kidderminster): Possibly WGY (Schenectady).

W. E. G. (Abergele): WL, apparently wrong; can trace no station on about 460 m. giving dance music at that time.

Continental Relay (Carlisle): (1) Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen, dance music from the Palace Hotel; (2) Koenigsusterhausen, relaying dance music from Berlin until 1 a.m. G.M.T.; (3) If WL, correct, possibly Leningrad; (4) Details too vague, cannot trace; possibly U.S.A. station; (5) Huizen (Holland); (6) Hamburg, New Year's Ball and Revue; (7) Too vague, regret, cannot trace; (8) Madrid (EAJ7), Die Csardasfurstin (Kalman).

Xmas (Forest Gate): Radio Toulouse (Interval signal: metronome).
