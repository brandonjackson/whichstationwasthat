V. 2. (Dublin): Cardiff, relaying dance music from the Winter Gardens Pavilion, Weston-super-Mare.

W. E. M. (S.W. 12): Frankfurt-on-Main, relaying dance music from the Tanzklause.

O. E. P. (London): Apparently a relay of the Stockholm programme, with which your details would tally, but we cannot say which as your estimate of WL. is too vague.

Oh My: Either Copenhagen or Kalundborg relaying Copenhagen, but cannot say which as you give no estimate of WL.

H. K. Hardy (Hants): (1) Rome (a lady announcer); concert of light music; (2) We know of no station on a WL. between that of London and Leipzig, but your details would tally with Radio LL, Paris.

Nitram (Birmingham): Cologne.

W. E. Walker (Sunderland): WGY (Schenectady) was relayed by Frankfurt-on-Main, and passed on, we believe, to most of the other German stations; you apparently heard this through Munich.

Enquirer (Busby): Copenhagen, working later than advertised in programmes.

M. Procter (S. E. 1): You give no estimate of WL. but possibly Kalundborg relaying Copenhagen.

Listen (Moseley): If WT listens approximately correct, WPG (Atlantic City).

H. Wilson (East Sheen): An amateur transmission; but cannot trace as you give no call sign.

G. E. Clarkson (Streatham): Frankfurt-on-Main relaying dance music from the Tanzklause.

4 Valve (South Devon): Radio Paris, working until 3.0 a.m.

E. J. Power (Dublin): Regret, cannot trace without some estimate of WL.

Radiation II (Victoria): AFH, Nauen (Germany).

Fido (Bristol): No, this was Berne.

Polar (Rumney): WGY (Schenectady) was relayed by Frankfurt-on-Main, and passed on, we believe, to most of the other German stations; you apparently heard this through Nürnberg.

Taffy (Colchester): Motala, relaying Gothenburg.

R. B. Winn (Wimbledon): No, this was Copenhagen.

Bondi (Edgware): (1) Cologne; The Magic Flute (Mozart); (2) The nearest French station to your estimate of WL. which you would hear at any great strength is Lille, relaying from the Coliseum at Paris; (3) WL. wrong; Berlin, also taken by Stettin, Koenigswusterhausen, Leipzig and Dresden.

L. D. (Kidderminster): Possibly WGY (Schenectady).

W. E. G. (Abergele): WL. apparently wrong; can trace no station on about 460 m., giving dance music at that time.

Tulip (Black-burn): Posen, a request programme.

Continental Relay (Carlisle): (1) Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen, dance music from the Palace Hotel; (2) 11 a.m. GMT; (3) I estimate dance from Berlin until 1 a.m. GMT; (3) 11.30 a.m.; (4) Paris, the Paris stations.
