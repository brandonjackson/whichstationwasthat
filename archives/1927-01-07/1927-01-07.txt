Willey (Earlsfield): (1) Bruenn; (2) Berne.
Yorkist (Bootham): (1) 6PY, amateur (Barnsley); do not know power of transmission; (2) we do not often receive reports of reception of U.S.A. stations from your district.

Domicile: If "W." in morse, Warsaw, but believe you misread the call, as the transmission tallies with that of Barcelona (EAJ13), Radio-Catalana.
The Old Man (Eastbourne): You enclosed no coupons.
Solodyne (Nottingham): Radio-Normandia, Caen (France), on 277.6 m.
B. M. J. E. R. S.: Presumably Moscow (Radio-Peredacha), but no programmes available.
V. T. A. (B.): Karlsborg relaying Stockholm (scenes from Romeo and Juliet).

Hush-Listen (Totley): Time of transmission and wavelength would tally with Leningrad, but programme not available.

Nosey Parker (Llandudno): Cannot trace this transmission possibly Bilbao.
W.D. C. (Hornsey): Berne.
Twiddler: Cannot trace by your condenser readings; if on about 66 m., Berlin short-wave transmitter relaying broadcast programme.

Neutrophase Four: (27) This was the new Dutch station at Scheveningen-Haven testing. Power in aerial is given by announcer as 2½ kw. and wavelength 1,950 m.

Straight Three Valver: Madrid EAJ7 or EAJ4.
T. H. Thomson (Edinburgh): Strassburg (222.6 m.).

Hopeful Bolshe (Birmingham): Bergen.
4 Valve (Grimsby): Moscow (RDW).
Nippon (Golders Green): You will find that this was Dresden relaying Leipzig.
Erna (Bognor): Of what did the short English announcement consist? No Dutch station on this WL., possibly Madrid (375 m.) giving an English lesson, followed by news.
Gee-Wat (NW3): Barcelona (EAJ1).
R. P. Reynolds (Croydon): Without estimated WL. cannot trace transmissions. Your aerial coil forms part of aerial circuit, and consequently length of aerial must be taken into consideration. Tables given showing range of WL. covered by a coil are usually based on the standard P.M.G. aerial when shunted by 0.0005 condenser. What are your natural WL. of coil would depend on length of aerial.
Guess-Guy: Eiffel Tower relaying PTT, Paris.
Oliver One-Valve: Breslau.
Indigrah (West Bridgford): Cannot trace; evidently an amateur transmission.
O-V-1 (E. 6): Elberfeld (468.8 m.).
Igranic Seven: Certainly Spanish by call-sign (hota), Madrid EAJ1.
J. H. M. O. (County Waterford): (1) Surely Barcelona (EAJ1); (2) Uppsalka is a very small station, but if WL. is correct, can only say that programme tallies as to time and dance music.
Ernest E. S. Williams (Wokingham): 2GG, amateur (Newbury); 4 O.K. is not a call sign.
