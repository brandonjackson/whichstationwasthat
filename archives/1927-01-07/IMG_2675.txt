Solodyne (Nottingham): Radio-Normandia, Caen (France), on 277.6 m. B.M., E. R. S.: Presumably Moscow (Radio-Perechadca), but no programmes available.
3 V.T.A. (B.): Karlsborg relaying Stockholm (scenes from Romeo and Juliet). Reinartz (Newton): If afternoon, cannot trace; if 1 a.m., W.L. too indefinite to identify U.S.A. transmitter.
Revlac (Fulham): Prague. D.K. Super-Snipe (Chichester): Milan. W. E. A. 4 (Reading): Bruenn (relay of service from Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul). Two Valve (Godreaman): Prague (sacred service relayed from the St. Wenzrel Basilica at Smichov). Mealy (Sittingbourne): Possibly Zagreb, but not advertised for that time. Southgate (Parkstone): Koenigsberg. DX5 (Caister): (1) apparently WBZ (Springfield); (2) Sunday was 26/12 not 28/12; if Sunday, PTT, Paris; (3) EAJ3 (tres) is the call of the Cadiz station, but wavelength is 344.8 m., possibly relayed by Bilbao (EAJ9); (4) Rather vague; either Karlsborg or Moscow (RDW). Hush-Listen (Totley): Time of transmission and wavelength would tally with Leningrad, but programme not available. Hardy (Sutton-Scotney): if W.L. correct apparently Riga, but we are more inclined to believe that you heard Munich; (73) Bordeaux (Lafayette) relaying concert from PTT, Paris W.L. is supposed to be 308 m.; (74) not Marseilles (PTT) on about 351 m. (W. & G. Imperth): Madrid (EAJ7 or EAJ4).

The time signal (Onogo system) is relayed from the German station: Nauen. Nosey Parker (Llandudno): Cannot trace this transmission possibly Bilbao. W.D. C. (Hornsey): Berne. Twiddler: Cannot trace by your condenser readings; if on about 66 m., Berlin short-wave transmitter relaying broadcast programme. Crystal Reflex: Prague. Neutrophase Four.: (27) This was the new Dutch station at Scheveningen-Haven testing. Power in aerial is given by announcer as 2½ kw. and wavelength 1,950 m.

L. S. (Darlaston): Radio-Paris. Pettipher (Chipping Norton): Berne relay of Basle; “Midnight Mass” from St. Mary’s Church, Basle. Vario (Guisborough): Moscow (RDW). Arabian Nights: Sorö relaying Divine Service from the Church of St. Frederic, Copenhagen. F. D. (Bolton): Latest list gives 2 US as the call-sign of an amateur at Cholmeley Park, London.
