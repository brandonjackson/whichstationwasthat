Roy Oliver (Northallerton): Moscow (RDW).  
K. M. B. (Osbournby): WL. too vague possibly Cadiz (EAJ3).

Willey (Earlsfield): (1) Bruenn; (2) Berne.  
Yorkist (Bootham): 6PY, amateur (Barnsley) do not know power of transmission; (2) we do not often receive reports of reception of U.S.A. stations from your district.

A. L. C. (Leicester): Possibly Hilversum relay of 5XX.
