Willey (Earlsfield): (1) Bruenn; (2) Berne.

Panto (Brasschaet, nr. Antwerp): Basle taking the Lausanne programme through the Berne station.  
Thornhill (Newcastle, co. Down): In this instance you were tuned in to Leipzig.  
Pensarn (Malvern Link): Call was misunderstood, as transmission undoubtedly tallies with Barcelona (EAJ1).  
A. L. C. (Leicester): Possibly Hilversum relay of 5XX.  
Domicile: If "W." in morse, Warsaw, but believe you misread the call, as the transmission tallies with that of Barcelona (EAJ13), Radio-Catalana.  
The Old Man (Eastbourne): You enclosed no coupons.

Hush-Listen (Totley): Time of transmission and wavelength would tally with Leningrad, but programme not available.

Gee-Wat (NW3): Barcelona (EAJ1).
R. P. Reynolds (Croydon): Without estimated WL. cannot trace transmissions. Your aerial coil forms part of aerial circuit, and consequently length of aerial must be taken into consideration. Tables given showing range of WL. covered by a coil are usually based on the standard P.M.G. aerial when shunted by 0.0005 condenser. What are your natural WL. of coil would depend on length of aerial.
Guess-Guy (Elfre):ces), Barcelona (EAJ1).
R. P. Reynolds (Croydon): Without estimated WL, cannot trace transmissions. Your aerial coil forms part of aerial circuit, and consequently length of aerial must be taken into consideration. Tables given showing range of WL, covered by a coil are usually based on the standard P.M.G. aerial when shunted by 0.0005 condenser. What you term natural WL, of coil would depend on length of aerial. Guess-Guy: Eiffel Tower relaying PTT, Paris.
Oliver One-Valve-Indigraph (West Bridgford): Cannot trace; evidently an amateur transmission.
O-V-1 (E 6): Elberfeld (468.8 m.).
Igranic Seven: Certainly Spanish by call-sign (hota); Madrid EAJ4.
J. H. M. C. (County Waterford): (2) Uppsala is a very small station, but WL is correct, can only say that the programme tallies as to time and dance music. (1) surely Barcelona (EAJ1).
