(2) Bilbao (EAJ11).  
Etherite (Norwich): We can trace no station broadcasting an opera by Wagner at that time. Berlin gave The Vampire (Marschner). If you heard the same programme from Dortmund, it was Orpheus in the Underworld (Offenbach) transmitted by Langenberg.  
Elstree (Leeds)-Stiffy (Liverpool): Milan (altered programme); a relay from a theatre of a performance of Verdi’s opera Aida. Confirmed by many listeners.
