     Line: Searcher (Rusholme): The new 2 kilowatt transmitter at Copenhagen testing. S.S.B. (Hale): PTT Lyons, relaying from Cabaret. McQuarrie (Liverpool): According to your condenser settings, the W.L. would tally with that of Kalundborg, which with at least two of your items agree. Apparently the previous night's transmission was a test. Oojah 4 (Maida Vale): Cadiz (experimental concert). Controlo-dyne (Pinner): Yes, Moscow Comintern (RDW). Stringed instrument, possibly Balalaika. Craven (Leeds): WGY (Schenectady). Old Boy (Barnsley): This was Hilversum. A concert of gramophone records. Curley (Plumstead): (2) Huizen (Holland). A coupon must be sent with each enquiry. Ding Dong (Burnley): W.L. wrong! Langenberg. Relay from the Gurzenich Hall at Cologne, followed by concert from the Handelshof, Essen. Chimes are from the studio. Coupon must be sent with each enquiry. Raleigh 3 (Bromley): WJZ (Boundbrook). The chimes are from the Langenburg studio. W.E. Jordan: Huizen (Holland), organ recital. This station works on 1,850 m. until 1.40 p.m. G.M.T.; afterwards on 1,950 m. Seven Times (Glasgow): An amateur transmission, but cannot trace. Low Wave (Grays): Yes, 2NM amateur. Caterham, Surrey. Ben Hur (Finchley): WGY Schenectady, from the Restaurant Nimb. A. H. Wiggins (Brookfields): The new transmitter at Copenhagen testing music, possibly from the Restaurant Nimb. P. Flower (Brislington): Cannot trace morse stations. Hayes (Taplow): Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen (Old dance music). A. Barrett (Oxford): Either Muenster or Dortmund relaying Langenberg (Balalaika and Bandoneon concert). W.E.T. (Pontefract): Moscow Comintern (RDW). Pleated Dia (Liverpool): Frankfurt-am-Main, relaying Cassel, late concert. The latter station has a lady announcer. Stevenagian: Apparently a U.S.A. station, but cannot trace as your details are too vague. E.P.M.D. (Westbury-on-Trym): Langenberg; probably heard through Muenster. Sidbert (Plumstead): Copenhagen, dance music, probably relayed from the Restaurant Nimb. T.W.3 (Scottland): Motala testing (gramophone records). Night Owl (Sussex): Hilversum (a concert of gramophone records). Arrow (Ayr): Falun, relaying dance music from Stockholm. Worthing (Sussex): If you are sure this was not Huizen, we cannot trace, but your details would absolutely tally with this station, which was broadcasting a language lesson at the time on 1,950. Padre (Camberley): Posen was the only station on or about your estimated W.L.; but the event did not take place until 7.30 p.m. and it was not possible that there had been a recital, but this would be carried through by many local stations.
