mondsey): Much too vague; so many stations work at that 
about that WL. Sunday's transmission might tally with 
Kattowitz, which was giving election results at that time. 
Sirrah (Lewisham): Kaiserslautern on 204.1 metres, relaying 
Munich. Mikado (Glasgow): Kattowitz; gramophone re- 
cords in the intervals of-broadcast-of election results; all 
Polish stations were working at that time. Your other 
transmission was from Posen. O.H.V.* (Hackney): No, de- 
tails would tally with Danzig, relaying Königsberg. Dixie 3 
(Regent's Park): (1) Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen; 
chimes from the Town Hall at midnight (11 p.m. G.M.T.); 
(2) Yes, Cologne. Haytor (Mitcham): Item not given in 
programmes; Dresden relayed light and dance music from 
Leipzig at that time. Big Ben (S.W.10): (1) This was the 
Munich programme; apparently received through Kaisers- 
lautern (204.1 m.). (2) PTT Lille; (3) No, Leningrad. 
P.M.O.K. (Wandsworth): Norddeich (Germany) weather 
report. Rose (Blackheath): WL: apparently wrong; a 
Polish station, possibly Kattowitz, broadcasting election 
results with gramophone records in the interval. Snevo: 
Regret, cannot trace any programme to tally with your 
details or on about that WL. mulcos: Yes, all Polish 
stations were giving election results on that date; they did 
this either through Kattowitz or Wilno. Radio (Staines): 
Motala now working on 1,380 m., relaying Stockholm (news 
and weather report). Pen (Bexhill): Apparently an amateur 
transmission of gramophone records. W.G.H. (Bristol): 
Oslo (concert by the station orchestra). Three Valver (Lan- 
cashire): Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen; a relay of 
5GB; this station frequently relays London and Daventry, but 
it is not always advertised in programmes. Super 7 (Pendle- 
ton): Kattowitz, broadcasting election results; news is given 
in French and Polish. J.G. (Derry): Moscow (Continental 
(RDW). Night Owl (Walthamstow): No, WGY (Schenectady) 
received direct; many readers heard this transmission on that 
night. Worried (Surbiton): Motala on this new WL. of 1,380 m. 
Snip (Westcliff-on-Sea): (1) We cannot see no play given at 
any station at 10 a.m. on a Sunday. Pittsky: Apparently 
short wave transmission from Radio LL, Paris. Stumm 
(Lincs): Regret, cannot trace, as no estimate of WL. is given. 
G.W.W. (Paddington): No, Posen, Kattowitz and Cracow 
broadcasting election results with gramophone records in the 
intervals. Kenvic (Manor Park): No German station adver- 
tised a relay of foreign stations on that date, but this 
sometimes carried out by Berlin, Stuttgart and Munich.
