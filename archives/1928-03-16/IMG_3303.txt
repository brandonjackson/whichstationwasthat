Oscry (Dartford): PTT Rennes, relaying concert from PTT Paris.
W.P.H. (Colchester): No, WGY (Schenectady) received direct.

S.W.C.G.3 (Redifield): (1) Possibly WTAM (Cleveland), (2) WRC (Washington), takes the WGY (Schenectady) programme; it is the nearest station to your estimated WL; WIOD (Miami Beach, Fla.), confirmed by other reports, (4) possibly WHAM (Rochester).
Kim (New Headington): (1) Are you sure that this was not 5WA (Cardiff) testing? (2) an amateur transmission; regret cannot trace as you give no call sign.
