Stage (Gloucester): We cannot confirm, but possibly Stockholm which advertised a relay of foreign stations at that time.
Crucible (S.W. 3): (1) Kattowitz, election results (gramophone records in the intervals). (2) possibly WTAM (Cleveland), U.S.A., which is often received in Britain.

Twin Reflex (Hammersmith): WGY (Schenectady) received direct.
C. L. V. (Bucks.): Although you give many details we cannot make any search as you give no idea of WL.

Rostrovser: Regret, we cannot trace this transmission.
G. T. C. (Heald Green): WGY (Schenectady) received direct.
