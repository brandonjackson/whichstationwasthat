FAW1 (Cornwall): Possibly Copenhagen.  
H.B.S. (Hambrook): Apparently WJZ, (Boundbrook).  
H.P. (Peckham): Leningrad.  
J.E.J. (Horden): Posen, and Kattowitz, election results with gramophone records in the intervals.  
Schoolboy 3 (Barrow-in-Furness): Yes, WGY (Schenectady) received direct.  
Aitchol (Wakefield): This would appear to have been a test by Eiffel Tower, previous to the advertised 5.45 p.m. transmission; possibly experimenting on a lower WL., about 1,450 m.  
R. Burleigh (E. 12): An amateur transmission.  
Melody (Redditch): (1, 4, 5, and 6) Either amateur relays, or harmonics, (2) Cologne, Pelleas and Melisande (Debussy), (3) Naples (request programme).  
Carfax (Surrey): If your estimate of WL. is approximately correct, Moscow Comintern (RDW), but this station does not come between Motala (which is now working on 1,380 m.) and Leningrad.  
Steward (Islington): (1 and 2) yes, details and time tally with 3LO (Melbourne) and 2FC (Sydney).  
JJ-AAA-MMM (Somerset): GNI, Niton (Isle of Wight).  
J. M. M. (Benview): Cologne (chimes from the studio).  
Nescio (Moffat): (1) Were all Cracow broadcasting election results (gramophone records in the intervals), as with an SLF condenser, the line would be fairly straight.  
Miracle (Watlington): Hamburg, the early morning broadcast of news and weather, and talk for the housewife; gramophone records in the intervals.  
C.E.J. (Purley): The only stations giving an outside broadcast at that time were Frankfurt-on-Main (operetta), and Leipzig (Faust): cannot trace on your estimate of WL.  
Oneflat (Burton-on-Trent): Dublin, relaying Cork.  
Kettle (Fulham): (1) Dublin, relaying Cork, (2) Madrid (EAJ7 operetta - Marina Arrieta), (3) Posen and Kattowitz, broadcasting election results (gramophone records in the intervals).  
Ann Matilda: Kalundborg, relaying 5GB; this station frequently relays London and Daventry, but it is not always advertised in programmes.  
Berto (Darlington): All Polish stations were broadcasting election results at that time, with gramophone records in the intervals; you heard Posen, Kattowitz and Warsaw.  
Nomad (Peterborough): (1) Details are too vague, you do not say whether in the English or a foreign language; if the former, possibly an amateur, (2) possibly Kattowitz which was broadcasting election results at that time, (gramophone records in the intervals).  
West (Crygll): This was Motala (now working on 1,380 m.)  
X. (Darlington): 2XQ, Rocky Point, Long Island, New York, testing on various WL. from 16–40 m.
