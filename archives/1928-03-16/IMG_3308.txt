Scrutator (Somerset): Motala, now working on 1,380 m.
W. J. Gillott (Birmingham): Yes, WGY (Schenectady) received direct.

Sedgewick (N. 16): Dinky (M’bro’): Kattowitz, broadcasting election results, with gramophone records in the intervals.
Lindum (Guildford): Yes, WPG (Atlantic City).
Getemall (Seven Kings): (1) Possibly KDKA (East Pittsburgh), (2) yes, details would tally with Madrid (EAJ7), (3) yes, WEAF (New York), (4) possibly Barcelona (EAJ13) at that time, but cannot confirm as no programmes are available.
Cosmel (Newark): Kalundborg, relaying 5GB; this station frequently relays London and Daventry, but it is not always advertised in programmes. Chimes are taken from the Town Hall, Copenhagen, at midnight (11.0 p.m. G.M.T.).

Two Valve (Redfield): Yes, WGY (Schenectady) received direct.
Knobs (Switzerland): We know of no Budapest station on that WL.; foreign transmitters frequently relay, thus puzzling listeners in regard to WL.
Chink (Newton Ferrers): Although not advertised in programmes, your details would tally with a late dance transmission from Copenhagen.
Coldstream (Colnbrook): All Polish stations were broadcasting election results at that time with gramophone records in the intervals; you apparently received this through Posen.
