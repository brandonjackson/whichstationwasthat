Your details are too vague; we cannot trace.  

Burton (Bellingham): An amateur transmission (H. W. Everett, 30, Greenock Road, S.E. 9).  

Knab PM4: This was apparently a relay, but we regret that we cannot trace the transmitter. See reply given to “Moon, Dublin.” Are you sure that you heard 2 a.m. chimes at 2 a.m.?  

Vallis (Oxford): You give no estimate of wavelength. This item was not advertised in the Stockholm programme, but it is quite possible that it was included.
