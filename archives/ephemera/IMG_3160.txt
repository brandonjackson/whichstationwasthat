Mysterious Musical Intervals at Nürnberg.

LISTENERS when tuning in Nürnberg, the famous toy manufacturing town, will have noticed faint music, mostly singing accompanied by a large orchestra, during the intervals. This is not caused by a station on an adjacent wavelength, but is actually transmitted by Nürnberg, although quite unintentionally.

The special underground cable connecting the relay Nürnberg to the main s’ation in Munich contains a second line used for broadcasting by “wired wireless” the performances from the Munich Opera House. Any subscriber to the ordinary telephone service can, for a small extra charge, listen regularly by means of his telephone to the excellent operas, which during ten months in the year delight the ears of the Munich audiences. This service encompasses, for the moment, the three towns owning broadcast transmitters, viz., Munich, Augsburg, and Nürnberg.

Induction effects are therefore the cause of this mysterious music, which can be heard faintly during even the slightest pause in the broadcast performance.
