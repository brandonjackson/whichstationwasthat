outside. The interfering noises were caused apparently by charged rain drops striking the aerial.

New hours for week-end transmissions were announced recently by both WGY and KDKA.

2XAD is now at work from 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. Greenwich Time on Saturday evenings, whilst 2XAF comes on at 11.25 p.m. KDKA is transmitting on 62.5 and 26 metres from 11. p.m. onwards on Sundays. I tuned in 2XAD at 7.30 p.m. last Saturday and found him coming through wonderfully well. Those who like to hear American stations need no longer complain that they must sit up until the small hours !
