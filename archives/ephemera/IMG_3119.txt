100 Stations Identified. Sir,—Just lately in the course of a few nights’ run over the stations between 187.5 and 2,650 metres, I have succeeded in listening to and identifying no less than 100. This seems a good proportion out of the list you give week by week, and as so many stations are on a common wave, and there is hopeless jamming at a number of other places, the total is, perhaps, not bad for a 3-valve set. It would certainly seem that, situated as we are here, about 10 miles from the east coast, we are not unfavourably placed for receiving Continental stations, allowing for the scourge of morse. Apart from 5XX, 5GB, and 2LO, the most satisfactory and dependable loud-speaker stations seem to me to be the Germans, which it is almost always a pleasure to listen to. Other stars of the firmament are, however: Malmo, Milan, Dublin, Prague (when not interfered with), Madrid (EAJ7), Toulouse (Rad. du Midi), Glasgow, Bruenn, Rome, Aberdeen, Brussels, Rosenhügel, Zürich (when it can be heard between the morse), Hilversum, Warsaw, Kalundborg, Motala, Moscow (RAI), Radio Paris, Kosice, and Eiffel Tower. The French stations, considering their generally small power, are often comparatively strong, and the same remark applies to the low-power Swedish relays late at night. The way in which some stations situated on a common wave sort themselves out above the noise is very interesting. If any of our German friends happen to be members of a happy little group of half-a-dozen stations-on the same wave, one may be sure that they, at any rate, will not be the ones to take the wall. Cork, however, is a pushing young person; he sorts himself out from the six other stations on 400 metres, and although fading lamentably is quite of respectable volume at times.—Yours faithfully, E.
