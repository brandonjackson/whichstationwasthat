Snap (Old Colwyn): Koenigswusterhausen (2,900 m.) Press news only.
Detector (Glasgow): (1) PTT Lyons, relaying either PTT Paris or PTT Marseilles; we cannot say which, as no detailed programmes are published.
Cynric (Amberley): Your details are rather vague, but it would appear to us that there are two transmissions in question. So far as we know, there was no relay of any speeches in English by a French station on that date, and there is a possibility of your having picked up a transmission from KDKA (East Pittsburgh). When you moved your condenser, you probably heard the PTT Marseilles call.
Puma: Hilversum, relaying orchestral concert from the Royal Cinema at Amsterdam.
Piper: We cannot trace any programme on about 800 m.; curiously enough, your details absolutely tally with the Hilversum advertised programme.
St. Audrey (King's Lynn): Leningrad (about 1,000 m.).
Margalo (Bognor): (1) Your details would tally with the Milan programme; this station was giving a concert by the Verdi Choral Society at that time. So far as we know, Breslau was not working at 1.11.5 p.m. on that evening. 
Mac: Gounod’s Faust was not advertised in any European programme, but from reports received from other listeners, we believe that this was given over Copenhagen or Stockholm. The Scandinavians frequently relay each other's transmissions, and if your W.L. is correct, you received this through Kalundborg.
W. J. C. (Northumberland): (1) See previous answer; you possibly received this through Kalundborg; (2) Moscow Comintern, relaying from theatre.
F. J. B. (Folkestone): Milan, relay of an operetta.
Billy Boy (Muswell Hill): Stuttgart. Preliminary and Interval Signal: 3 notes, C, D, G, produced by oscillating valves.
Nynehead (Somerset): PTT Paris, which has been occasionally working on higher W.L., and Langenberg.
W. R. H. (Belfast): Your details are too vague; some estimation of W.L. must be given as several stations close down in this manner.
Bass (Preston): Yes, Berlin (483.9 m.).
Ripley (Birkdale): Kalundborg, relaying Church service from Stockholm.
Spa (Hendon): (1) PTT Lyons; (2) details would tally with Oslo.
Adsum (Cardiff): Regret, cannot trace, as you give no estimation of W.L.
Query (Trowbridge): No, more possibly Madrid. Radio España (EAJ2). Cádiz is now on 344.8 m. 
DX Grayhound: (1) Apparently an amateur transmission; cannot trace; (2) Klangenfurt, relaying orchestral concert from Vienna; (3) PTT Lyons; (4) No, Bremen, relaying concert from the Café Continental at Hanover; (5) Either San Sebastian (EAJ8), or Madrid, Radio Madrilena (EAJ12); (6) Possibly Bilbao (EAJ11); (7) Quite possibly PTT Lyons, working on higher wavelength; (8) Yes, PTT Marseilles; (9) Apparently Tron
