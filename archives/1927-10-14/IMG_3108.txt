Novice (Wokingham): Glasgow, relaying a service from St. Cuthbert's Church at Edinburgh.
Dotty (Ringwood): (1) Leipzig, relaying dance music from Berlin until 12:30 a.m., September 26, 1927; (2) Breslau; (3) PTT Lyons, taking the Paris relay of dance music from the Coliseum.
J. Turner (Morley): (1 and 2) Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen.
T.G.P. (Wakefield): PTT Lille. A comic opera, Manon (Massenet).
2 Vaiver (Nottingham): (1) If WL correct, Huizen (Holland) testing; (2) Norddeich (Germany) weather report; (3) Moscow Comintern (1,450 m.); (4) Possibly Leningrad (about 1,000 m.).
Internacia Lingua: (1 and 1a) Cannot possibly trace as you give no estimation of WL. From the closing down with a gong, we should say that it was a harmonic of Hamburg or Hanover, relaying a concert from the Hotel Continental at Hanover; (2) PTT Paris, relaying dance music from the Coliseum; (3) It is very difficult to identify a short wave transmission unless the estimate of WL is positive, but from your details, we should say that it was KDKA (East Pittsburgh), but would not like to confirm.
Bunny: (1) Norddeich (weather report); (2) It is impossible for the present to say which Spanish transmitter was behind the Madrid (EAJ7) programme, because one did not hear of any alterations in wavelengths.
Arderiser Solodyne (Inverness-shire): Apparently the new Bucharest station testing reported to be working on about 1,600 m.
Acot: Bilbao (EAJ9), relaying Madrid (EAJ7).
1 Valve (Seaton): (1) Yes, Nürnberg, relaying orchestral concert from Munich; (2) Prague (variety concert); (3) Motala, relaying Stockholm (cabaret).
Rectifier (Leeds): (a) PTT Marseilles; (b) Yes, details would tally with Cracow, which was relaying a concert from Warsaw at that time; (c) PTT Lille.
KILEF: Possibly WGN (Chicago) 305.9 m.
Dee Bee (Birmingham): (1) We can trace no transmission on or about 470 m. that would tally with your details; (2) Radio LL. Paris, testing previous to the 9.15 p.m. concert; (3) so far as we know PTT Paris was giving a news bulletin at that time; possibly Barcelona (EAJ13).
Tim (W. 12): Yes, Cardiff, relaying a religious service in Welsh, from Crwys Road Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Church.
W.F. (Belfast): Langenberg, relaying Dortmund until 1 a.m., October 2, 1927; also taken by Muenster.

C.O.D. (Grimsby): this was Falan (356.1 m.).
