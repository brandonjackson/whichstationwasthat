that time, (2) Bergen, (3) details are too vague, regret, cannot trace, (4) yes, apparently amateur transmission, but cannot trace, as you give no call sign, (5) possibly Leningrad (about 1,000 m.), (6) possibly the new station at Bucharest, which is reported to be testing on about 1,600 m.
Hearmour: Your estimate of WL is too vague; 350-450 m. would include at least 40 European stations. If you are sure this was German, possibly Hamburg, which was relaying a concert from the Alster Pavilion at about that time, but cannot confirm.
J. Y. (Ashford): Hilversum (gramophone records).
Selsibia Two: Hilversum (Holland), from 10.10 to 11.40 p.m. a concert by the Hawaiian Band.
Horologist (Bexhill-on-Sea): Your WL is slightly wrong, this transmission was heard by other listeners, and details well point to a test from Huizen (Holland) on 1,840 and 1,950 m.; possibly gramophone records.
Demesner (Markethill): Amplifier; Huizen (Holland), testing on 1,840 and 1,950 m. See reply to previous query.
Edina 111: Nürnberg, relaying Munich.
J. Bramhall: Stuttgart on Tuesday, October 4, was the Baritone Umberto Wibano of the Scala Theatre, Milan.
St. Audrey: Warsaw (studio concert).
M. E. Y. (Chichester): (1) Yes, possibly Warsaw, but item not advertised in programme, (2) No, we cannot trace a German station on that WL, but the items would tally with Frankfurt.
Station Hunter (Blythe Bridge): WGY (Schenectady).
H. E. (Bern): This was an experimental transmission carried out by a British amateur, 2NM Caterham, Surrey, on 33 m.
J. W. Earl (Leicester): Your estimate of WL is apparently wrong, regret, cannot trace, (1) we cannot trace any reading under this title from a German station, (2) if Spanish possibly Barcelona (EAJ1).
