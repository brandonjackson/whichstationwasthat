Snap (Old Colwyn): Koenigswusterhausen (2,900 m.) Press news only.
Detector (Glasgow): (1) PTT Lyons, relaying either PTT Paris or PTT Marseilles; we cannot say which, as no detailed programmes are published.
Cynric (Amberley): Your details are rather vague, but it would appear to us that there are two transmissions in question. So far as we know, there was no relay of any speeches in English by a French station on that date, and there is a possibility of your having picked up a transmission from KDKA (East Pittsburgh). When you moved your condenser, you probably heard the PTT Marseilles call.
Puma: Hilversum, relaying orchestral concert from the Royal Cinema at Amsterdam.
Piper: We cannot trace any programme on about 800 m.; curiously enough, your details absolutely tally with the Hilversum advertised programme.
St. Audrey (King's Lynn): Leningrad (about 1,000 m.).
Margalo (Bognor): (1) Your details would tally with the Milan programme; this station was giving a concert by the Verdi Choral Society at that time. So far as we know, Breslau was not working at 1.11.5 p.m. on that evening.
Mac: Gounod’s Faust was not advertised in any European programme, but from reports received from other listeners, we believe that this was given over Copenhagen or Stockholm. The Scandinavians frequently relay each other's transmissions, and if your W.L. is correct, you received this through Kalundborg.
W. J. C. (Northumberland): (1) See previous answer; you possibly received this through Kalundborg; (2) Moscow Comintern, relaying from theatre.
F. J. B. (Folkestone): Milan, relay of an operetta.

Spa (Hendon): (1) PTT Lyons; (2) details would tally with Oslo.

DX Grayhound: (1) Apparently an amateur transmission; cannot trace; (2) Klangenfurt, relaying orchestral concert from Vienna; (3) PTT Lyons; (4) No, Bremen, relaying concert from the Café Continental at Hanover; (5) Either San Sebastian (EAJ8), or Madrid, Radio Madrilena (EAJ12); (6) Possibly Bilbao (EAJ11); (7) Quite possibly PTT Lyons, working on higher wavelength; (8) Yes, PTT Marseilles; (9) Apparently Trondheim relaying Oslo. The Dance of Death, a drama by Strindberg; (10) Possibly Bordeaux, Radio Sud-Ouest on higher WL; (11) Possibly Orebro; your details would tally with the Stockholm programme.
H. J. (Walthamstow): (94) Brussels, relaying concert from the Palais de Danse St. Sauveur; (95) Possibly Copenhagen (children’s hour); (96) Stuttgart; (97) Hamburg; (98) Rome. The Girl of the Golden West (Puccini); (99) Glasgow, relaying service from St. Cuthbert’s Church at Edinburgh; (100) Koenigswusterhausen, relaying the Hindenburg celebrations from Berlin. This was also taken by Langenberg.

K. Kalundborg, relaying Wagner concert from Copenhagen.
2 Volt, 3 Valver, L. F. (Sheffield): Your details are rather vague, but if in English, possibly Radio Foundation; also, Cannes could be heard.
E. V. B. (Sheffield): Leipzig, 10.15 p.m. to midnight, dance music.

C. E. C. (West Derby): Hilversum. A gramophone concert of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony in C Minor, by the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra, conducted by Sir Landon Ronald.
Inquirer (Hampshire): Apparently a relay of the Hindenburg celebrations from Berlin. This was taken by many of the German stations, but as your WL. is so vague, it is impossible to say which of the transmitters you heard.
G. R. S. N. (12): Possibly Radio Toulouse, but no programme was advertised for this station at that time; if gramophone records, an amateur transmitter.
BM/BBN7 (Upminster): Kalundborg, relaying a Wagner concert from Copenhagen.

Internacia Lingua: (1 and 1a) Cannot possibly trace as you give no estimation of WL. From the closing down with a gong, we should say that it was a harmonic of Hamburg or Hanover, relaying a concert from the Hotel Continental at Hanover; (2) PTT Paris, relaying dance music from the Coliseum; (3) It is very difficult to identify a short wave transmission unless the estimate of WL is positive, but from your details, we should say that it was KDKA (East Pittsburgh), but would not like to confirm.
Bunny: (1) Norddeich (weather report); (2) It is impossible for the present to say which Spanish transmitter was behind the Madrid (EAJ7) programme, because one did not hear of any alterations in wavelengths.

Kingsdown (Bristol): Yes, Moscow Comintern (RDW).

Distance Urge (Shepherds Bush): (1) Stettin, relaying Berlin. On October 3, 1927, relay of the opera La Traviata (Verdi); (2) your estimate of W.L. is too vague, cannot trace; (3) regret, cannot trace as you give no estimation of W.L.; (4) your details are very vague, but possibly Danzig, which was relaying an English lesson from Koenigsberg at that time.

Hearmour: Your estimate of WL is too vague; 350-450 m. would include at least 40 European stations. If you are sure this was German, possibly Hamburg, which was relaying a concert from the Alster Pavilion at about that time, but cannot confirm.
J. Y. (Ashford): Hilversum (gramophone records).
Selsibia Two: Hilversum (Holland), from 10.10 to 11.40 p.m. a concert by the Hawaiian Band.
Horologist (Bexhill-on-Sea): Your WL is slightly wrong, this transmission was heard by other listeners, and details well point to a test from Huizen (Holland) on 1,840 and 1,950 m.; possibly gramophone records.
