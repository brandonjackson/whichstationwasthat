Cannot trace, as it is seldom these special relays are mentioned in programmes; but from description given would say this was a Spanish station.  
Froth-Blower (Hunstanton): Yes, a U.S.A. station, but estimated WL. is too vague to allow of identification.  
Straight-Three (Wisbech): Radio-Toulouse.  
Baby : Too vague; cannot trace.  
Low Waves: Possibly WBCD (Zion, Ill.) on 344.6 m. (5 kw.), but cannot confirm.  
R. C. H. (Edinburgh): (1) Kiel relaying Hanover (Café Continental); (2) Swedish relay of Stockholm, either Malmö or Norrköping ; most probably the former station.  
Howman (Norwich): Letter received, but no enquiries enclosed.  
C. R. B. (Worcester): (1) Moscow (RDW); (2) same station; (3) Elberfeld.  
J. W. L. P. Z.: Zurich.  
Curious (St. Ives): Cannot trace transmission from your condenser settings.  
Yarn (Halifax): (1) somewhat vague, but probably Basle relaying Berne ; (2) Lausanne; (3) Stettin relaying Berlin; (4) Basle; (5) Sorö relaying Copenhagen; (6) Leipzig; (7) Lausanne.  
Reflex (Norwich): Madrid [EAJ4] on 375 m. or EAJ7 on 373 m.  
If You Please: (1) Elberfeld (Children’s Hour); (2-3-4) no coupons sent.  
D. D. (Loughboro): No, Madrid (EAJ7) relaying opera from Barcelona (EAJ1) (Teatro del Liceo).  
Skewenite: Hamburg (gramophone records).  
F. C. S. 3 (Nailsworth): Prague relaying from the National Theatre.  
H. D. W. (W6): Leipzig.  
William I Valve: (1) Union - Radio stations are EAJ1, 3, 5, and 7. EAJ4 is also testing on 350 m.; (2) Barcelona (EAJ1). Cadiz (EAJ3) on 344.8 sometimes relays EAJ1; (3) possibly Nuremberg relaying Munich.  
115 (Glasgow): No coupons sent.  
One-Valve (Offenham): Your estimation of WL. is wrong; dance music, in this instance, was from Koenigswusterhausen (1,300 m.).  
Puzzled (Bolton): Cannot identify transmissions unless you give some estimation of WL., but from other details stated should say that this was Leipzig.  
Naturwissenschaft (Leicester): No. call was “Radio Sevillano” (Seville EAJ17) on 300 m.  
Avalkaneda (Southport): Yes, this was a transmission by Rome, but probably relayed by some foreign station.  
Chin-Chin-Chow (Treorchy): Apparently two amateur experimenters.  
Poyser (Derby): You must give some estimation of WL. to assist in identification of transmission. In this case, however, we can definitely state that you heard Leipzig.  
Longueville (Mallow, Co. Cork): Prague relaying Boheme from National Theatre.  
P. M. (Golders Green): (1) Prague (relay from National Theatre); (2, 3, 4) no coupons sent.  
MacGregor (York): Prague relaying opera, La Boheme, from National Theatre. Please estimate WL.; condenser dial readings do not assist us.
