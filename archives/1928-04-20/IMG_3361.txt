Gipsy Love (Lehar).

H. F. Swan (Surrey): Koenigswusterhausen relaying Berlin; concert of Tea Music from the Hotel Kaiserhof.

Valver (Edinburgh): WL. We regret, but it is impossible to trace these short wave transmissions unless the estimate of WL. is much more definite; there are so many stations on wavelengths between 31.4 and 83 metres.

Etherian (Northampton): 2RO amateur at Leicester, but we cannot give name and address.

Beta (Ireland): Huizen (Holland), gramophone records.

P. C. (Staffs): 5NW, amateur at Dundee.

Wireless Reggie (Kingsway): (1) Scheveningen-Haven (Holland), Stock Exchange, market prices, etc. (2) WL. apparently wrong, regret, cannot trace.

Ixopo (Dorset): Huizen (Holland), gramophone records.

Blystra (Cornwall): 5NW, amateur at Dundee.

I. A. Rance (Dorset): Huizen (gramophone records).

DX (Penllwyn): Surely a relay of Teddy Brown's Band from the Café de Paris, London; either from Newcastle or Belfast.

Spark Gap (N.16): Apparently Leipzig, although so late a transmission would be advised.

E. H. Chappel (Beckenham): Hulzen; details of the programme were not published. This, however, was a gramophone record, possibly of the reception of Colonel Lindbergh at Washington. It tallies with the details reported by other listeners.

E. C. H. (Kingston): (1) Regret, cannot trace. (2) Seville, relaying Madrid (EAJ7), dance music from the Alcazar, Madrid. (3) apparently Luxemburg on 217 m., (4) Münster relaying from Cologne "The Speech and Music of Nations," illustrated by gramophone records.

The Village (Finchley): We cannot trace any official transmission on that WL., possibly an amateur.

Selenite (Nelson): (1) WABC (Richmond Hill), on 64 m., (2) possibly 3XL (Bournesbrook, N.J.), on 59.96 m. (3) we do not know of a spanish station on that WL, possibly 1AX, Rome, (4) yes, EATH, Vienna.

Juno (Sheffield): Madrid (EAJ7), chimes from the Home Office, Madrid.

P. M. G. (Lincs.): Yes, Moscow frequently broadcasts lessons in Morse; the second portion referred to the German trans-Atlantic fliers.

Schoolboy (Ilford): (1) We cannot confirm, but believe that Stuttgart broadcast later than advertised on that night. (2) yes, Radio Paris, ten minutes’ gramophone records after the news bulletin.
