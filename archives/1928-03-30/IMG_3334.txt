Alannah (Hull): You give no estimate of WL; no, not Italian, apparently a Spanish station, but cannot say which.

Dimic Four (Cornwall): Yes, this was Kalundborg relaying foreign stations. This station frequently works later than advertised in programmes.

Winnipeg (Doncaster): 5YW advertised as amateur transmitter at Wolverhampton.

Schoolboy (Sea Houses): Eiffel Tower testing on short waves.

Picky (Dudley): (1) Without doubt a relay of PTT Paris, with which the programme tallies, but cannot understand your WL. Marseilles on that evening advertised its own concert; possibly PTT Limoges; (2) yes, the first harmonic of Hamburg; (3) another relay of PTT Paris; cannot trace from WL given; not Bordeaux, as Radio-sud-Ouest is not a PTT station. Juan-les-Pins is still on 257 m.

Chippy C. S. S. (Sheffield): (1) An amateur transmission, but cannot trace call sign; (2) details are too vague, regret cannot trace; (3) 5SW, B.B.C. experimental station at Chelmsford.

St. Jacut (Dodgesdon): Madrid (EAJ7) relaying from the Gran Teatro del Liceo at Barcelona.

Homestead 11 (E.7.): Naples, relaying opera from the Theatre San Carlo.

CP. 377: Frankfurt-on-Main (Nelson Revue).

Tourist (Cowbridge): Warsaw (a lady announcer), news followed by a relay of dance music.

Exukindoo (Donzy) (Schoener): Received direct Breslau (Tenor solos).

Family Four (Belfast): Kalundborg, relaying dance music from the Palace Hotel at Copenhagen; chimes from the Town Hall at midnight.

Roscoe (Chadwell Heath): This was Dublin. See detailed programme in World-Radio.

Dodo (Nuneaton): This was an amateur transmission, but cannot trace as you give no call sign.

Renmus (Leyland): (4) WL wrong; Augsburg relaying Munich; (5) Milan (Vigentino) relaying opera from the Lyric Theatre; (6) PTT Lille (own concert); (7) PTT Rennes, relaying PTT Paris; (8) details are too vague, regret cannot trace; (9) quite possibly Juan-les-Pins, which has been picked up occasionally.

Enthusiast (Paddington): Yes, Zurich; (1) Details are very vague, but possibly Cassel, relaying Frankfurt-on-Main; (2) PTT Toulouse; (3) Kiel, relaying cabaret from Hamburg.

Conductor (Leyton Depot): KDKA (East Pittsburgh) apparently received direct, as we know of no European station working at that time.

Oscillating (Mosely): (1) Surely 2LO, The Master Builder (Ibsen). You did not say that you had identified Stuttgart.

Welcome Three (Glasgow): You do not say whether the talk was in English, in which case it would appear to be an English lesson; but cannot trace in programmes.

W. G. H. (Bristol): (1) Apparently Kattowitz (altered programme); (2) PTT Lyons.

Orchid, John (Beaconsfield): Interested (Dovercourt): British.
