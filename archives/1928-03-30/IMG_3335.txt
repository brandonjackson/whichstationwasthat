fragment: (1) Without doubt a relay of PTT Paris, with which the programme tallies, but cannot understand your WL. Marseilles on that evening advertised its own concert; possibly PTT Limoges; (2) yes, the first harmonic of Hamburg; (3) another relay of PTT Paris; cannot trace from WL given; not Bordeaux, as Radio-Sud-Ouest is not a PTT station. Juan-les-Pins is still on 257 m.
Chippy C. S. S. (Sheffield): (1) An amateur transmission, but cannot trace call sign. (2) details are too vague, regret cannot trace; (3) 5SW, B.B.C. experimental station at Chelmsford.
St. Jace (Hoddesdon): Madrid (EAJ7) relaying from the Gran Teatro del Liceo at Barcelona.
Homestead 11 (E7.): Naples, relaying opera from the Theatre San Carlo.
CP 377: Frankfurt-on-Main (Nelson Revue).
Tourist (Cowbridge): Warsaw (a lady announcer), news followed by a relay of dance music.
Exmundiney (Dover): (1) WGY (Schenectady received direct; (2) possibly WJZ (Bounbrook) ; (3) WL. wrong, this was Breslau (Tenor solo).
Family Four (Belfast): Kalundborg, relaying dance music from the Palace Hotel at Copenhagen, chimes on the Town Hall at midnight.
Roscoe Chadwall: This was Dublin. See detailed programme in World-Radio. Good work; this was an amateur transmission.
fragment: (4) WL. wrong : Augsburg, relaying Munich; (5) Milan; (6) P T T  Viqenttino relaying opera from the Lyric Theatre ; (6) PTT Lille (own concert) ; (7) PTT Rennes, relaying PTT Paris ; (8) details are too vague, regret cannot trace; (9) quite possibly Juan-les-Pins, which has been picked up occasionally.
Enthusiast (Paddington): Yes, Zürich. (1) Details are very vague, but possibly Cassel, relaying Frankfurt-on-Main; (2) PTT Toulouse; (3) Kiel, relaying cabaret from Hamburg.
Conductor (Leyton Depot): KDKA (East Pittsburgh) apparently received direct, as we know of no European station working at that time.
Oscillating (Moselcy): (1) Surely 2LO, The Master Builder (Ibsen). You did not say that you had identified Stuttgart.
Welcome Three (Glasgow): You do not say whether the talk was in English ; in which case it would appear to be an English lesson ; but cannot trace in programmes.
W. C. H. (Bristol): (1) Apparently Kattowiz (altered programme) ; (2) PTT Lyons.
Askewood, B, E, E, Pete, Orchil, John (Beaconsfield) & Infotested (Dovercourt): British & (Bradford).
