Garra (Prestbury): (1) Yes, Moscow Comintern (RDW); (2) Huizen (Holland) working on 1,840 m., and after about 7 p.m. on 1,950 m. 

Longhackle (Beckenham): Berne (a concert of Swiss music and songs). 

Magpie (Wokingham): This was Koenigswusterhausen, which gave an English lesson at that time.

Novice (Wokingham): Yes, Oslo.

V.H.T.Z. (Hull): U.S.A. station; possibly WGY (Schenectady).

S.W.C. 4 (Redfield): (1) Bilbao (EAJ9) possibly relaying Madrid (EAJ7); (2) Yes, Huizen (Holland) working on 1,840 m. and after about 7 p.m. on 1,950 m.; (3) Koenigswusterhausen (English Lesson).

A.D.J.A. (Leicester): (1) Motala, relaying dance music from the Operakällaren Restaurant at Stockholm; (2) WL. wrong; Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen. A concert of old dance music, followed by a relay from the Restaurant Wivel, Copenhagen.

B. (Woodhouse): Prague (Czecho-Slovakia), relaying from café.

Call: Hallo! Praha.

Yak How (Penrith): Yes, Stamboul, which was giving dance music at about that time.

Woadet (Leith, N.B.): A cure would be too vague, regt cannot trace. Only one coupon is needed for each enquiry.

J.E.M. (Llanelly): If your estimate of WL. is correct, this was Radio Paris.

Loudspeaker (Hythe): Most of the German stations on the high wavelengths were giving dance music at that time; as you give no estimate of WL. it is impossible to trace.

Ludwig (Northwood): (a) Your WL. is surely wrong; details would tally with Warsaw, which was relaying dance music from the Hotel Bristol at that time; (2) PTT Lyons.

Continental (Bristol): Prague, relay of orchestral concert; also taken by Bruenn and Bratislava.

The Old Man (Eastbourne): Lausanne (680 m.) Protestant Church Service.

Music Lover: Cork, relaying organ recital from St. Mary’s Church in that city.

Polyphilus (Sydenham): Moscow Comintern (RDW).

(Holbeck): Frankfurt-on-Main, relaying Cassel; the latter station has a lady announcer.

Radiano (Cardiff): Apparently an amateur transmission, but cannot trace as you give no estimate of WL. or call sign.

K.A.U. (Brighton): Your estimate of WL. is rather vague, but possibly Stamboul.

Thure (E.12): (1) Yes, a species of harmonic; (2) Croydon, Le Bourges, Lympne, St. Inglebert, etc.; on 900 m.

R.F. Bennett (Romford): Between Koenigswusterhausen and Warsaw you would hear Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen, Stamboul (Turkey), and Boden, relaying Stockholm, but we feel sure that your wavelengths are rather different from these stations on October 23 owing to transmission.
