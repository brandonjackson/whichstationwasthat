Thure (E.12): (1) Yes, a species of harmonic; (2) Croydon, Le Bourget, Lympne, St. Inglebert, etc., on 900 m.
R. F. Bennett (Romford): Between Koenigswusterhausen and Warsaw you would hear Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen, Stamboul (Turkey), and Boden, relaying Stockholm, but we feel sure that your wavelengths are wrong, as transmissions from these stations on October 23 do not tally with your details.
S.W. 18 (Liverpool): You would appear to be receiving trans-Atlantic telephony on a harmonic. Superseterodyne: Most certainly not Graz; possibly Seville (EAJ5), but no programmes for this station are available.
P.A. O. (Barum): (1) Yes, possibly Kharkov on 1,700 m., but programmes are not available to confirm; (2) Yes, Huizen (Holland); this station transmits on 1,950 m. at about 7.30 p.m.
Red Seal (Langwith): (1 and 2) Huizen (Holland) on 1,840 and 1,950 m.
Kemyst: Cannot trace any station that would tally with your details at that time; apparently an amateur transmission.
Three Valver (Lewisham): Yes, Stuttgart, relaying pianoforte recital from the Liederhalle.
Messabout: (1 and 2) Huizen (Holland) on 1,840 and 1,950 m.; (3) same as (1 and 2), gramophone records, possibly of the Wembley Tattoo.
Schoolboy (North'd): Yes, Tumour; your details would tally with the programme (Turkish music).
Patricia (Brighton): Yes, Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen. A concert of classical operetta music.
Straight Two (Inverurie): Your estimate of WL is wrong; Warsaw is not between Motala and Koenigswusterhausen; your details, however, would tally with the advertised programme. Singer: J. Turczynska.
F. Foster (Somerset): (1) We regret that we cannot trace the stations you heard, as you give no estimate of WL, and condenser readings do not help; (2) apparently an amateur transmission.
Annanite (Annan): Yes, Bergen, relaying Church service from the Johannes Church.
L. Oldale (Woodhouse): (1) you give no date, but details would tally with the Huizen (Holland) programme for October 24; (2) no date given, but possibly Barcelona (EAJ1). Proprietary names must not be used as noms de plume.
Pica (Watford): Yes, so far as we can say from your details, this was Langenberg.
Graphist (Scunthorpe): Huizen (Holland) Epilogue.
Query (Sheerness): Huizen (Holland) testing on 1,840 m. Gramophone records, possibly of the Wembley Tattoo.
Unknown (J.P.): This was Kalundborg, relaying a concert of classical operetta music from Copenhagen.
E. V. B. (Portsmouth): Huizen (Holland) 1,950 m.
3 Valves (Walton-on-Thames): An amateur transmission, but cannot trace as you give no call sign.
B. H. (Chichester): (1) Stuttgart, relaying
