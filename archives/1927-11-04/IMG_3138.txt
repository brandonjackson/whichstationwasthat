Chelston (Wallington): (1) Stuttgart, (2) Possibly Frankfurt-on-Main.
Jonny Strikes Up (Ernst Krenek) relayed from the Opera House; (3) cannot trace, details too vague. It is very difficult to identify station heard from your condenser readings. Coupon must be sent with each inquiry.
Neutro-Mains 4 (Rotherham) WL. surely wrong; details would tally with Kalundborg, relaying dance music from Copenhagen. At midnight (11 p.m. G.M.T.) chimes from the Town Hall.

Canton (Birmingham, X24 (Finchley): Frankfurt-on-Main. A request programme of gramophone records.

P. (Eastbourne): WL. apparently wrong, details would tally with Frankfurt-on-Main. A request programme of gramophone records.
