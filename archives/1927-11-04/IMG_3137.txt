Unkown (J.P.): This was Kalundborg, relaying a concert of classical operetta music from Copenhagen.  
E. V. B. (Portsmouth): Huizen (Holland) 1,950 m.  
3 Valves (Walton-on-Thames): An amateur transmission, but cannot trace as you give no call sign.  
B. H. (Chichester): (1) Stuttgart, relaying pianoforte recital from the Liederhalle. Interval Signal: Three notes, C, D, G, produced by oscillating valves; (2) We regret that we cannot trace, as it is impossible to identify stations without some estimate of WL., your condenser readings do not help us.  
Vale (Thornbury): From about 7.30 p.m. this station transmits on 1,840 m.  
Searcher (Rusholme): (18) if WL. correct, Madrid (EAJ7); (19 and 20) yes, quite possibly Notodden and Porsgrund, relaying Oslo. Election results with dance music in the intervals + (21) cannot trace; (22) Radio Lyon; (23) very vague, but possibly Innsbruck relaying Vienna; (24) Nürnberg, relaying Munich. A concert of the works of Richard Wagner; (25) WL. wrong, Koenigsberg.  
The Masteringers of Nuremberg (Wagner) (26) WL. surely wrong, regret, cannot trace (27) yes, Augsburg, relaying Munich; (28) possibly Brussels (29) would tally with Radio Paris.  
Lewlyn (Gound): We regret that we cannot trace as you give no estimate of WL. and condenser readings do not help, but we should say that you heard Spanish stations at that time.  
Knave-go-by (Camborne): Huizen (Holland) testing.  
Rosa (Malton): (1) possibly PTT Rennes, which is testing on about 320 m.; (2) Milan advertised 30 minutes or so of light music at 10 p.m.; transmission may have been extended.  
Selective: The only relay of a sporting event that we can trace at about that time was that given by Breslau and Gleiwitz from the Centenary Sports Arena. It is quite possible that this was also taken by another German station.  
Variety Fiend (Nunehead): (1) Breslau; (2) very vague, but possibly Muenster, relaying Langenberg; (3) Danzig, relaying Koenigsberg; (4) Koenigsberg; (5) cannot trace.  
Beginner (Bognor): Frankfurt-on-Main. A request programme of gramophone records.  
F. L. B. C. (Chatham): Yes, Posen. Mandoline orchestra, with soprano and tenor. At 10 p.m. Time Signal and weather report.  
Old Rock (Staffs): A Spanish station, at that time; if WL. correct, Bilbao (EAJ9), possibly relaying Madrid (EAJ7).  
J. Dennie (Santander, Spain): Cannot trace. It would appear to be a telegram sent by wireless telephony.
