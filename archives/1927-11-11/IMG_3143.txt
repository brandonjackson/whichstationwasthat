Valver (New Southgate): (1) Nürnberg, relaying guitar concert from Munich. (2) Barcelona (EAJ1) relaying Madrid (EAJ7). Selection from a musical play.  
G. E. C. (West Derby): Moscow Comintern (RDW).  
Jam (Bristol): (1) Muenster, relaying Dortmund. Organ recital relayed from the St. Reinoldi Church, followed by a relay of a talk from Cologne via Langenberg. (2) Your details are too vague, regret, cannot trace.
