S. (Harrow): Basle, relaying Berne.
J. G. (Derry): Rather vague, but possibly San Sebastian (EAJ8).
Curious (York): We believe this to be Almeria (Spain) on about 315-319 m.
Four Valver (Bristol): An amateur transmission, but cannot trace as you give no call sign; (2) wireless telegraphy station, not a broadcaster.
Carocross (Solihull): Madrid (EAJ7), altered programme.
Anything (E. 11): Apparently gramophone records, but we cannot trace any Continental station working at that time on or about 450 m.

Derf (Morley): It is almost impossible to trace from condenser settings, but from details of items given, A and B would tally with Kovno (talks) and Leningrad (surely not a preacher!), C and D cannot trace.
Lass: Moscow Comintern (RDW).
Dioptric (Southwark): Amateur transmission, 2NM Caterham (Surrey) 23 and 33 m.
