broadcasts through Scheveningen-Haven, and also, we believe, through Hilversum, but in this case news bulletins only.

Curios (Hull): Bordeaux-Lafayette is transmitting on various wavelengths and may possibly abandon 419.5 m. The station advertises transmissions on 275, 238, and 419 m., but these are subject to variations.

Mother of Six (Leicester): (1) If you are sure it was not PTT Paris, we cannot trace any other French transmission on that wavelength, (2) yes, Belgrade testing; it has been reported by several readers.

M. X. (Belfast): Leipzig. Thanks for information.
