Sure, here is the transcribed text:

Swensey: Wavelength estimate too vague. Hilversum playing "Zampa" ? Moscow. Nomad (Peterborough) : Hälsingborg. S.W.4.: Cannot trace on this wavelength. 

Aidöna (Dublin): Regret cannot form an estimate of wavelength from your information. Black Eagle (Hastings): Boundbrook (N.J.), WJZ. Burt (Canterbury): Motala. Snooked (Cardiff): Wavelength much over-estimated. Motala. Mac (Porto): (3) No; (4) Kalundborg; (5) too vague. Inquisitive Bill (Leicester): Kalundborg. Puzzled (Ulverston): We do not understand your reference to Koenigsusterhausen on "1,380." Reflex (Brighton): Hamburg. Tony (Swindon): Hilversum playing "Zampa" at 5.15 p.m. Learning (Cornwall): We think your wavelength is wrongly estimated. Gong: (1) Motala; (2) Copenhagen; (3) Nürnberg relaying Munich; (4) Motala; (5) are you sure of your wavelength? Short Wave (Teignmouth): Cannot trace on this wavelength. Call was probably "Radiophonie." 

A. E. (Liverpool): We doubt your wavelength. Can you name a known station near the unknown ? J. F. S. (Tidworth): San Sebastian. Links (Edinburgh): (1) Oslo; (2) Points to Madrid (EAJ7) with altered programme; (3) Cannot trace such a transmission. A. R. M. (Ilford): Kalundborg. Candida Case (Carlisle): We have no information on this point and cannot trace in programmes. Alaskan (Southend): (1) Leningrad; (2) PCJJ or Bergen according to wavelength. 4JERS: (1) Leningrad; (2) Wavelength estimate too vague. Hilversum or Warsaw; (3) Kalundborg (Prof. Dr. Lorentzen); (4) If wavelength certain. Kharkov; (5) Koenigsusterhausen; (6) Motala; (7) Huizen. Rex (Bournemouth): Kalundborg relaying Copenhagen from restaurant Nimb. 4 Valve (Pembrokeshire): Motala. Jim-Jam (Birmingham): Surely Brussels. Elldee (Luton): Kattowitz. Baxter (Walsall): Oslo gave this talk on February 6 at 8.30-9 p.m. (through Rjukan). Forest (Epping): Likely to be 3LO, but wavelength of Short Wave stations must be definite. Night Hawk 5 (Cannington): (1) WPG; (2) KDKA. Searcher (Shalford): Air Ministry Station. North Pole (Inverness): Wilno, relaying Warsaw. Constable (Warrington): (1) Not near that wavelength, (2) Hamburg. 

Loftus (S.W. 18): Leipzig relaying Dresden. Morse Martyr (Weymouth): Barcelona. Arcadia (Thornton Heath): Perhaps Madrid (EAJ7), but some idea of wavelength should be given. Pizzicato (Northants): Kalundborg relaying Copenhagen. Angus (Newport): If wavelength certain, KJR (Seattle). Wave Trap (Northampton): Madrid (EAJ7). A. J. S. (Small Heath): Berlin. Filadyne Three (Norbury): Copenhagen. B. A. (Stourbridge): Direct. G. S. C. (West-gate): Radio Beziers. Dalton (Airdrie): Frankfurt.
