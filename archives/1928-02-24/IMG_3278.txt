A considerable number of correspondents wrote us enquiring about a very late transmission (up to 3 a.m.) which they heard on Saturday night, February 4/5. This was a relay by Leipzig and other German stations of dance music at the Opera Ball, taking place at Dresden. The late transmission was not indicated in the Leipzig programme.
