Kurzon (Derby): Cassel relaying Frankfurt. Your wavelength is considerably overestimated.

Ocete (N. 10): Rjukan relaying Oslo programme.

Short Aerial (Leeds): If you are sure of wavelength, probably 3LO which transmits gramophone records at this time.

Rhondda: We cannot form an estimate of wavelength from your dial reading. Are you sure of the call heard? Can you give reading of known station near it?

Bijou (Louth): Regret we cannot say without some indication of wavelength. Possibly an Italian station on 45 m.

Ingham (Pinner): Leningrad.

J. D. (Portsmouth): Cologne.

Jan (Enfield): Possibly Copenhagen (337 m).

Alpha (Llanelly): Huizen.

Calibration (Dalston): Only British station giving a service at that time was Belfast. Is that consistent with your dial reading?

One Valve (Croydon): Leningrad.

Haines Hill (Taunton): Either Bandoeng (Java) or Kootwijk (Holland).

Barnard (Clapham): Copenhagen.

Enoch (Glasgow): Regret, impossible to say without some idea of wavelength; dial reading alone insufficient.

Bulldog (Barton): Leningrad.

Mikado 2 (Tottenham): Probably an amateur.

J. F. S. (Tidworth): If wavelength certain, Salamanca (Spain).

Rose (Thurso): Yes, Moscow.

Golden Bay (Clovelly): (1) Nürnberg relaying Munich; (2) Leipzig relaying Dresden; (3) Oslo.

Bellairs (Goring): Kalundborg relaying chimes, 6 strokes (5 p.m. G.M.T.). If reading is below Koenigswusterhausen, cannot trace the transmission.

Two Valver (Eltham): Kattowitz.

Pilgrim (Bromdesbury Park): Cracow.

Basil Faulds (Louth): Details point to Warsaw, but programme does not tally.

H. S. K. (Dunstable): Estimate of wavelength too vague to enable us to identify. Can you give dial readings of some known stations near it?

Wanderer (W. Harborough): Surely wavelength higher—Leningrad.

Three Valve (Chatham): Cannot trace. Are you certain of wavelength estimate?

Three Valver (Colwyn Bay): Radio Toulouse.

Tyro (Radnor): (1) Leningrad; (2) Wire Beacon Station.

Melody Maker (S.E.A.): Wavelength wrong. Probably either Cassel (236.2 m.) or Stuttgart (379.7 m.).

Gridleak (Hull): Radio Toulouse.

C. M. F. (Wimbledon): The stations referred to are Leipzig and Dresden.

Quest (London 15): Items named not traceable on estimated wavelengths.

Milliamp (Notts.): Madrid (E.A.J.7).

Old Bill: Vienna. English lesson.

G. Kearn (Southsea): We do not understand your question. Were you using short-wave dials?

Errant Three (Croydon): Muenster tallies with your dial reading, but was advertised relay-Hamburg.

Log Book (Hockley): WPG (Atlantic City).

Straight Three (Godalming):——

Nobby (Llandudno):——
