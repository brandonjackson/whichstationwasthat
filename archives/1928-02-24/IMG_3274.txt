Kearn (Southsea): We do no understand you. 

Errant Three (Croydon): Were you using short-wave dials? Muenster tallies with your dial reading, but was advertised to relay Hamburg.

Log Book (Hockley): WPG (Atlantic City).

Straight Three (Godalming): Leningrad.

Nobby (Llandudno): Transmission not advertised.

Wynne (Belfast): Motala relaying Stockholm.

J. W. B. (Malta): Kootwijk in communication with station which we cannot trace.

Hello America (Bristol): If your wavelength is approximately correct, it was Rjukan relaying Oslo. It was not Radio Barcelona.

J. C. W. K. (Halstead): Huizen, which transmits on 1,950 m. on Sunday. An oversight of ours. 

Keppel Bay: (1) Probably Berlin relaying foreign stations (we have no record which they were); (2) not sufficient evidence of wavelength. This must be indicated as precisely as possible.

Pointer (Kidderminster): Budapest.

Cobble (Preston): Your dial readings alone do not help us.

Solodyne 3 (Addlestone): Kovno.

D. F. (Brighton): Without some clue to the wavelength, impossible for us to reply.

Pullover (Bucks): Leningrad.

Cov-try: "Wavelength 425 m. or 300 m." Which do you mean? No such transmission on either.

Three Valve (Callington): (1) Kalundborg giving Copenhagen programme; (2) WHO, Des Moines (Iowa).

Barber (Wick): Regret details too uncertain to trace.

A. E. J. (Guildford): A longer annotation. (1) Are you sure of language? Several Swedish stations within that band. Wavelength estimate vague, but probably Josen. 

Alpha (R. Z.): Wavelength estimate vague. Likely to have been Paris. 

Ambrose (Bexhill): Leningrad.

L. C. J. 5 (Dartford): We have no information on this point.

Disclose (Wandsworth): Not Radio Barcelona, but Radio Catalana.

Acme (Woodford Green): Regret cannot trace.

Radio Rupert: Kalundborg.

BM/ORTM (Westcliff): Wavelength estimate vague.

S. B. B. (Hale): Moscow.

Nomad (Peterborough): Helsingborg.

S.W.4: Cannot trace on this wavelength.

Aldtona (Dublin): Regret cannot form an estimate of wavelength from your information.

Black Eagle (Hastings): Boundbrook (N.J.), WJZ.

Burt (Canterbury): Estimated. Motala.

Snooked (Cardiff): Wavelength much over-estimated. Motala.

Mac (Porto): (3) No; (4) Kalundborg; (5) too vague.

Inquisitive Bill (Leicester): Kalundborg.

Puzzled (Ulverston): We do not understand your reference to Koenigswusterhausen on "1,380."

Reflex (Brighton): Hamburg.

Tony (Swindon): Hilversum playing "Zampa" at 5.15 p.m.

Learning (Cornwall): We think your wavelength is wrongly estimated.

Gong: (1) Motala; (2) Copenhagen; (3) Nürnberg relaying Munich; (4) Motala; (5) are you sure of your wavelength?

Short Wave (Teignmouth): Cannot trace on this wavelength. Call was probably "Radiophonio."

A.E. (Liverpool): We doubt your wavelength.
