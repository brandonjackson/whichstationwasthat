Tinny (Oxford): Impossible to trace from coil numbers; W.L. must be estimated. A large number of Continental stations gave dance music at that time.  
P.N.Y. (Pinxton, Notts): The Koenigswusterhausen low-wave transmitter (58 m.) relaying Berlin.  
A.A. Six: The talk was given at the Oslo studio; you appear to have heard it through one of the relays.  
G. Walton (Liverpool): This would tally with the Hamburg relay of Bremen.  
Mutt: Bremen.  
Nippon (N.W. 11): Many thanks for your letter. A further search has been made. The fact that you distinctly heard a gong would tend to prove that this was a German or Austrian station. Apparently there were three transmissions at this time, all on neighbouring W.L.s, light music from Hanover (Cafe Continental); Dresden relaying Cabaret from Leipzig and possibly Radio-Agen (France) in background. The strokes on a gong would point to Dresden or Hanover.  
Mrs. Dog (Weybridge): (1) Regret we cannot trace; most certainly not Cardiff; (2) A relay of Stockholm's English service at that time.  
McMurtrie (West Croydon): A relay of Frankfort-on-Main (gramophone records).  
S.U. Tran (B.): WL. too vague to specify.  
J.H. H. (Dundee): Graz.  
Dee-Bee (Limavady): Not an advertised programme; evidently a test by a broadcasting station (German).  
Two-Valve (Tunbridge Wells): Cannot trace.  
All British Six (Dublin): Copenhagen (English programme).  
Rica (Bath): Frankfort-on-Main (English lesson).  
2 Valves (Acocks Green): WL. apparently wrong = Petit Parisien (Paris), broadcast The Waltz Dream (Strauss).  
R.E.K.P. (Deal): (1) Warsaw (new station); (2) Leningrad.  
H. Atkinson (Morecambe): Frankfort-on-Main relaying Mandoline concert from Cassel.  
R.F.G., One-Valve: No estimated wavelength given, cannot trace.  
Curious (Drogheda): Prague.  
Knob-Twister (Tottenham): "Radio Journal, Praha" or "Radio Praha."  
Madrid (EAJ7).  
Emro (Uttoxeter): Madrid (EAJ7).  
Davlow Three: You do not give any estimated wavelength, but from the call heard: Prague.  
Haler: Hamburg.  
Hopeless (Worthing): Why " hopeless " ? Yes, Scheveningen-Haarlem (Holland).  
W.H.W. (Sittingbourne): (1) Hamburg first news bulletin.  
G.H.P. Meggle: Hamburg first news bulletin.  
Horace Hopscotch (Eire): (2) Cadiz (EAJ8) first news bulletin.
