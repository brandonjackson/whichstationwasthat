Manager (Guernsey): Budapest.  
Derek (Guildford): Eiffel Tower, relaying Sunday concert from FPTT, Paris; on other days, lecture from Sorbonne University.  
A. W. (Coventry): Possibly WGY (Schenectady) low wave transmitter, on 32-79 m.  
Sambo (Herne Hill): Cannot trace; not in programmes.  
E. S. (Grimsby): Yes, Sorö.  
Jakob: Haeren (Brussels) in Flemish and French.  
Clet (Inverness): Hamburg.  
O-V-2 (Brixton): Café Korso is at Dortmund; this transmission was not mentioned in the programmes, but tests are frequently made with the German S.B. system since the advent of Langenberg; the relay may have been made to Breslau.  
Doc (Belfast): Call was "Hier Radio-Wien" (Veen)—Vienna, 517.2 m.  
Duman (Brighton): CDG interval signal from Stuttgart; you may have heard the Freiburg relay.  
Superial (Guernsey): apparently Radio Carthage on 1,800 m.  
Nonfolk: Langenberg.  
L. V. H. (Folkestone): cannot trace; you apparently overheard a private telephone call.  
Yam (Halifax): (11) tallies with Muenster.  
ST100/WF: cannot give you a definite reply—either Toulouse FPTT relaying Marseilles or Paris FPTT stations; after an exchange of their wavelengths has taken place—of which we have not yet been advised.  
Super Regenerative: (1) Kovno; (2) Cadiz, EAJ3; (3) Basle A.G.; Warsaw; (5) Gleiwitz.  
L. S. Salmon (Welling): Bordeaux-Lafayette relaying FPTT Paris.  
Bonnie Scotland: (a) Madrid, EAJ7 or EAJ4; (b) too vague—cannot trace.  
Sparke1s (S.W.1l): (11) Sorö relaying a service from the Church of St. Frederick, Copenhagen; (12) Radio-Paris (13) Leipzig (Das ChristelcEin).

Ether Bird (Derby): cannot trace—not in programmes.  
IV. John (Southgate): Bremen relaying the Children’s Hour from Hamburg.  
A. H. (Abbey Wood): Leipzig.  
F. T. (Southend): call sign is somewhat "distorted;" the items would tally with a relay of Gothenberg—apparently Karlstadt or Umea; but these are very low-power stations.  
Did I? (Portsmouth): would tally with transmission from Radio-Madrilèna, EAJ12, Madrid.  
P. P. V. 2 (Anstruther): Zurich (494 m.) relaying Berne.  
Talland (Leicester): Hamburg relaying Hanover.  
G. A. S. (Brighton): if W.L. correct, tallies with Sorö, but believe this was Hilversum (from St. Dominic Church, Amsterdam).  
Suiza: apparently Stuttgart, but programmes did not forecast late dance music—possibly Stuttgart relayed Langenberg.  
Pleated Dia. 2 (Aintree): Bern (orchestra Caligari).  
Trio (Brighton): Berlin (Wagner evening), 483.9 m.
