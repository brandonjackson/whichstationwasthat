A few words of explanation regarding the ceremony heard by a large number of listeners, whose noms-de-plume are published in the “Answers to Queries,” may be of general interest to our readers. The special broadcast picked up by them was that of the public demonstration held on the Square facing the Cologne Cathedral, in celebration of the official evacuation of that city after seven years’ occupation by British troops. The proceedings were opened at midnight (Central European time), or 11 p.m. (G.M.T.), by the pealing of the famous Cathedral Petrus Bell, after which the chief Burgomaster, Dr. Adenauer, delivered a short speech to the assembled crowd. The German National Anthem accompanied by a full band was then sung, followed by further speeches; a message from President Hindenburg was read, and a hymn, Grosser Gott, wir loben Dich, sung by the multitude, brought the ceremony to an end. The apparent war cry heard by one of our readers was merely a German “Hoch!” repeated three times, the Teutonic equivalent of the British cheer. This patriotic demonstration was relayed to Muenster, and re-broadcast by most of the German stations, including the high-power transmitter at Koenigswusterhausen.
