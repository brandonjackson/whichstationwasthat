Radiant (Rugby): Details very vague; (1) Motala (1,305 m.), weather report; (2) Berlin (1,250 m.); (3) Possibly Hilversum (1,060 m.).  
J. D. (Dublin): (1) Moscow Comintern (1,450 m.); (2) Motala (1,304 m.) relaying dance music from Stockholm until 12.15 a.m. 9/6.  
Watez (Hove): (1) Yes, Cardiff (353 m.) relaying Church Service from Portland Wesleyan Church, Bristol; (2) Possibly Falun (357 m.) relaying Church Service from Malmö.  
H. F. 42: (a) Yes, Cork (400 m.); (b) Yes, Bremen, relaying concert from the Café Continental at Hanover; (c) Yes, Hilversum (1,060 m.) Press; (d) PTT Toulouse (255 m.) relaying concert from Bordeaux-Lafayette; (e) Yes, Innsbruck (273 m.) relaying Vienna. Apparently worked later than advertised in programmes. Chimes heard, possibly from Leipzig (365 m.).

R. F. (Belfast): (1) Cannot trace any station giving a play at that time; (2) Possibly Rome (450 m.) Coupon must be sent with each enquiry.  
Three Valve Reflex (Glasgow): W.L. and details are vague, but would tally with Frankfurt-on-Main 428 m. (gramophone records).  
Grosier (York): Details are much too vague, regret cannot trace.  
Quatre V (Pontypool): Dortmund (283 m.) relaying dance music from the Fledermaus Cabaret.  
Straight Set (Brombrough): Cannot identify definitely, as details undoubtedly point to Sorø (1,153 m.), but Copenhagen did not advertise a dance transmission on that evening.

C. D. R. (Kettering): 5GB B.B.C. experimental station, Daventry. Your wavelength must be wrong as tests have not been made on a higher wavelength than 491.8 m. (610 kc.).  
10001 (Jersey): Details of late dance transmissions are never given in programmes; this was either Koenigswusterhausen (Berlin) or Motala (Sweden) taking Stockholm entertainment.  
S. T. (1001) (Redfield): Madrid (EAJ7); programme relayed from Barcelona (EAJ1).  
Topsham (Devon): Do not know of any broadcasting station working at that time likely to interfere with 5XX. Radio-Paris was giving a talk, as per programme.  
"Mystified" (Chippenham): We regret we cannot answer this from the apparently contradictory readings which you give. Can you furnish any more definite facts?
