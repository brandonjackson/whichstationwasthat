Details are much too vague, regret cannot trace.

Quatre V (Pontypool): Dortmund (283 m.) relaying dance music from the Fledermaus Cabaret.

Straight Set (Brombrough): Cannot identify definitely, as details undoubtedly point to Sorø (1,153 m.), but Copenhagen did not advertise a dance transmission on that evening.

2 Up (Harlow): (1) Yes, apparently Dublin testing, (2) yes, Leipzig (365 m.), (3) Nuremberg (303 m.) relaying Munich. (A musical play by Anzengruber.) (4) Glasgow (engineer’s test). Call heard when closing down; Glasgow and Dundee, (5) Yes, Frankfort (gramophone records), but not relaying Hamburg.

F. G. N. (Reading): (1) This was Naples (333.3 m.) relaying from the Alhambra Theatre, (2) Not Creacow, which was only working until 11.30 p.m. (relaying dance music from Warsaw), but possibly Bilbao (EAJ11) 423 m.

M. 633843 (Brighton): No, not PTT Toulouse, but Kiel (254 m.) relaying concert from the Café Wallhof, at Hamburg until midnight.

C. D. R. (Kettering): 5GB B.B.C. experimental station, Daventry. Your wavelength must be wrong as tests have not been made on a higher wavelength than 491.8 m. (610 kc.).

10001 (Jersey): Details of late dance transmissions are never given in programmes; this was either Koenigswusterhausen (Berlin) or Motala (Sweden) taking Stockholm entertainment.

S. T. (1001) (Redfield):
