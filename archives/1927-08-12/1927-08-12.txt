Horsey (Newark): Yes, Radio-Agen (310 m.).  
H. H. K. (Sussex): Cassel, relaying Frankfort.  
2 Valve Gets 'Em (E. 9): (2) Details rather vague, but would tally with Berlin, which was giving dance music at that time, (3) Frankfort-on-Main.  
J. W. B. (Malta): (12) Details are much too vague; regret, cannot trace, (13) details rather vague, but possibly Milan, which advertised a relay of an opera or operetta and may have worked later than stated in programmes. If Tosca, by Puccini, not Verdi.  
Elmo (S. E. 18): Regret, cannot trace.  
R. O. W. (W. 13): Hilversum, lunch music from 12.10 to 1.10 p.m., followed by recitations.  
Reflex (Dudley): Yes, this would tally with a test from Belgrade on about 1,650 m.  
J. A. P. R. (Moreton): No, this was Warsaw (1,111 m.) relaying dance music from the Restaurant Rydz.  
3 Valve (Alton): Reported by other listeners; this would appear to be Moscow (Comintern) 1,450 m. (late transmission; probably news bulletin).  
J. E. H. (Rhondda): (1) This would appear to be Moscow (Comintern), 1,450 m. Reports also received from other listeners, (2) Warsaw (1,111 m.). On July 31, relaying dance music from the Restaurant Rydz, but on August 1 this station did not, according to programmes, work until 12 midday, when it broadcast a time signal, weather report, and news bulletin.  
Hibernia (Loughrea): Confirmed by other listeners; this would appear to be Belgrade testing, on about 1,650 m.  
EA (Wells): (1) Yes, apparently an aircraft station, (2) according to reports received from other listeners, this would appear to be Belgrade, testing on about 1,650 m.  
All Wave Four (Dublin): Your WL. and details are too vague; regret, cannot. Possibly a Spanish station.  
Brenosa: La información que da Vd. es muy vaga, pero sugerimos que la emisora oída puede ser la de Radio-Lyon (291.3).  
Squidgers: We have had several reports of this transmission, the nature of which makes Norddeich very doubtful.  
Short Wave: Regret details too vague for identification.
