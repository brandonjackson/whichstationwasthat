S. H. 7: Too vague.  
Stumped (W.4).  
No German station on that WL; you are probably hearing Milan.  
C. H. R. Reflex: Prague. The call was “Allo Radio Praha” (the native name of the city).  
Radiomug (Castleford): Impossible to trace from your condenser set­ tings, but suggest Frankfort-on-Main.  
BM/BMBH: British Concertina (Barnsley).  
R. D. (Tamworth): No concert adver­ tised at that time on this WL, possibly Radio-Paris.  
Wick- low (1): Berlin (news on 1,300 m.); (2) Radio-Paris, relayed in Opera House. Was sung in German.  
S. M. M. (Argyll): Possibly WGY (Schenectady), as U.S.A. stations are now being heard stumped.  
Glaxo 14 G. G. W.: Hamburg. (Not a drama but a farce Minna von Barnhelm, by Lessing.)  
H. L. Hammal: Cannot trace details too vague.  
Quo Vadis (N22): Yes. Some estimated wl. must be given. The readings of your condenser does not permit us to trace a station.  
Curious (S.E. 13): Hamburg relaying Hanover (Café Continental). You heard “Deutsch- land ueber Alles,” not Russian National Anthem.  
S. E. Blatherwick: Not advertised, but Hilversum.

A. M. L. (Liverpool): Excellent result for a crystal set. Frankfort-on-Main Rigoletto relayed from Opera House. Was sung in German not English.  
Atmos Rudkin (Woolwich): 111 (Sunderland); E. J. K. (Canterbury): A very interest­ ing: transmission but not advertised in programmes. If complementary details noted at time of reception could be sent on to us, a further exhaustive search will be made, and replies published in a subsequent issue of this paper. Data given re WL from different sources is too contradictory to establish identity of transmitter.
