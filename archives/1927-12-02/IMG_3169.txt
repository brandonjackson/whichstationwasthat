Airlie (Leeds): Cannot confirm as programme not available, but we believe this to be Kattowitz.
Scottie (Battersea): Madrid (EAJ7).
Nobby Clark (Maidenhead): We believe this to be Kattowitze (Poland), which is working on 422 m. (a lady announcer), but cannot confirm as no programmes are available.
Globe Trotter (Eastbourne): (1) If your estimate of W.L. is correct, Motala, but this station was not advertised to work so late; possibly an altered programme; (2) Milan on 545 m.
Sorry to Trouble (Sefton Park): W.L. apparently wrong, as we can trace no station on or about that W.L. which would tally with your details.
A. Neal (Nunthorpe): (a) Barcelona (EAJ1); (b) Yes, Prague; (c) Lille PTT, relaying PTT Paris; (d) Boden, relaying symphony concert from Malmo; (e) Koenigswusterhausen; (f) Langenberg, relaying concert from Muenchen-Gladbach.
A. C. (Torquay): Kalundborg, relaying Copenhagen.
Kia Ora (Bolton): (1) We believe this to be Rome (IAX) on 45 m.; (2) KDKA (East Pittsburg) is now transmitting on this W.L.; (3) we do not know of any Spanish station on so low a W.L.; possibly PTT Toulouse.
Early Morn (Cambridge): We cannot confirm, but we believe Posen was testing at about that time on that date.
Dentist (Warrington); Wyche (Droitwich): Yes, apparently gramophone records; we believe this to be Kattowitz (Poland) testing.
W. E. R. (London): Most probably an amateur transmission at that time.
Mullard 4 De Lux: (1) Koenigswusterhausen; (2) Copenhagen, relay of service from the Garrison Church.
Brivett: Cannot trace in programmes; Madrid (EAJ7) was working until 12.45 a.m., but did not advertise a play.
Mayford (Axminster): From your details it is very difficult to identify transmitter; possibly KDKA (East Pittsburg) on 26 metres.
3 Valver (Dorset); W. M. (East Linton): Moscow Comintern (RDW).  News. M. does not tally with your details, as programme was different from the two neighbouring stations.
Two Valves (Gets): (2) Milan.
Brighton: (1) Moscow Comintern (RDW); (2) relay of Acts III. and IV. of Verdi’s Ernani.
Bonzo (Sidcup): Warsaw testing.
China (Birmingham): We regret that we are unable to trace your details; possibly Italy or France.
