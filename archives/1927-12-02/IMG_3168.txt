Hibernia (Loughrea): So far as we know Stuttgart did not relay WGY (Schenectady) on that date; you appear to have received this station direct.

Home Made (Newcastle): Bergen; English lesson by F. L. Somerville.

Ben Hur: It is very difficult to estimate W1. from your condenser readings, possibly Geneva, but cannot confirm.

Lisleen (Stanmore): Kalundborg, relaying dance music from one Restaurant Nimb at Copenhagen.

J. B. (Breeston): We regret that we cannot trace, as it is almost impossible to identify station heard without some estimate of W1., and your condenser readings do not help.
