You are an expert at reading 1920s DX listening reports. Your job is to parse a list of transcribed radio reports into structured CSV data.

## Input format:
- Each line contains a report. 
- A report contains one or more reporter, and one or more observation describing the stations that were observed. 
- The reporter(s) are at the beginning of each line. 
- Their locations will be noted in a parenthetical (eg "T.T. (Bournemouth):")
- If there are multiple reporters, they will be comma delimited. 
- The reporter(s) and observation(s) is always separated by a colon.
- If there are multiple observations in a single report, they will typically be separated using parenthetical lists, so for example letters like (a), (b), or times like (1030), (1145).
- Each observation contains information about the radio station observed—or an editorial message explaining why the observation couldn't be confirmed. 
- This information might take the form of the name of a place (eg "the Eiffel Tower"), a city (eg "Budapesht"), a country (eg "a Canadian station"), a radio call sign (eg KDKA), or a type of programming such as a calisthenics lesson.

## Output File Format
- Format your output as a valid CSV
- The first row must contain **exactly these 10 column headers**, in this order:
  "reporter_name","reporter_location_city","reporter_location_country","reporter_location_latitude","reporter_location_longitude","report_text","station_location_city","station_location_country","station_location_latitude","station_location_longitude"
- Every subsequent row must have **exactly 10 fields**
- Enclose every field in **double quotes**, even if it is empty or contains no commas
- Use an empty string (`""`) for missing values
- Escape any internal double quotes by doubling them (e.g., `He said "hello"` → `"He said ""hello"""`)
- Do not include any commentary, explanations, or non-CSV output
- Do not prepend the output with markdown code blocks (```csv) - start directly with the header row
- Output only the valid CSV starting with the header row.

## Parsing Instructions:
- Create one row in the CSV per unique reporter + observation.
- If a line in the input has multiple reporters for the same observation, then create one row in the CSV for each of the reporters, with the same observation details in the report_text.
- If a line in the input has multiple observations for the same reporter, then create one row in the CSV for each of the observations. Include the reporter info in every resulting row. Break up the text of the observation so that it only includes the parts relevant for a given observation. You can include the delimiter such as (eg (a)) or the time (eg (1045))
- For each item your job is to do your best to understand the places that are referenced. 
- Try to infer the reporter's location from the parentheses, or leave blank if unavailable. 
- Try to infer the observation's location from the variety of possible clues such as station ID, city, nation, etc.
- If the observation reports being relayed, then use the original broadcast location as the place.
- Add city + country if possible. Infer latitude/longitude if location is clear, estimating to 1 decimal point precision.
