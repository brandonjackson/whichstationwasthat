You are analyzing a regular magazine column from the 1920s. It consists of DX listening reports: short entries submitted by radio listeners describing what stations they received.

Your job:

This stage combines multiple OCR transcription snippets from a single week's column into one clean, unified digital transcript.

The input will contain text from several consecutive image snippets of the same magazine column. These may include:

- overlapping content across files. in this case, you should ensure that reports aren't duplicated.
- line fragments at the beginning of a snippet that complete a report started earlier - join these together with reports, don't put the fragment at the start of a new line
- garbled or incomplete line breaks caused by page boundaries or OCR artifacts

Your job is to cleanly stitch these snippets into a single, continuous transcript — removing duplicates and overlaps, resolving fragments, and applying formatting rules.

Do not normalize language or interpret the content. Just reconstruct the column faithfully.

Formatting rules:

• Each report must be on its own line (one line per reporter).
• A report follows the format: Reporter name (optional location): editor message and/or Station name (optional location).
• Sometimes reports have multiple reporters separated by commas before the colon.
• Punctuation is used intentionally. Colons almost always separate reporter and report, and periods almost always mean the end of a report (unless after an abbreviation like "Dec.").
• If a report has sub-entries (marked by letters like (a), (b) or times like (1030), (1230)), keep them all on the same line.
• If a line fragment appears at the start of a snippet (not beginning with a name + colon), treat it as a continuation of a prior report. Place it on its own line.
• Always output exactly one report or one fragment per line.
• Never merge two reports into one line, and never split one report across lines.

Examples (reports):
Marcel Hullot (France): Radio Iberica (Madrid), indicated EAJ6.
Dol (Limerick): yes Prague.
Amplidyn (Purley): (a) surely Berlin, but why weak phones? (b) insufficient detail, cannot trace.
Chippy (Chichester): seeing reference to children’s corner, at 9.20 p.m., presumably U.S.A. station.
Crane (Eaton): Hamburg.

How to handle fragments at start of transcript:
If a transcript starts with a fragment like "(b) about 458m.) not traceable; (c) An amateur." then you should try to connect it to the report at the end of the previous snippet, for example "Bennetts: (a) Petit Parisien 345m.;" This would result in the correct full report "Bennetts: (a) Petit Parisien 345m.; (b) about 458m.) not traceable; (c) An amateur."

Examples of fragments to be merged into preceding report include:
sub-entries like "(b) insufficient detail, cannot trace."
sub-entries like "(10.30) Hamburg; (11.30) Prague."
report text like "Hamburg."
hyphenated word segments from report-text like "berg."
reporter locations like "(Chichester): seeing reference..."
