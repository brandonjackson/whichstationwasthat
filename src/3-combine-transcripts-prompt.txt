You are analyzing a regular magazine column from the 1920s. It consists of DX listening reports: short entries submitted by radio listeners describing what stations they received.

Your job:

The transcript has already been automatically merged from multiple OCR snippets. Your task is to make final edits to ensure high quality and consistent formatting.

The input text may still contain:

- Line fragments that should be merged with previous reports (especially at line breaks)
- Formatting inconsistencies that need to be corrected
- Minor OCR artifacts that break the format

Make MINIMAL changes. Your job is to:
1. Handle any remaining line fragments that should be merged with previous reports
2. Ensure all formatting rules are consistently followed
3. Fix obvious OCR artifacts that break the format

Do NOT normalize language, change wording, or interpret content. Preserve everything as-is except for fragment handling and format fixes.

Formatting rules (must be followed consistently):

• Each report must be on its own line (one line per reporter).
• A report follows the format: Reporter name (optional location): editor message and/or Station name (optional location).
• Sometimes reports have multiple reporters separated by commas before the colon.
• Punctuation is used intentionally. Colons almost always separate reporter and report, and periods almost always mean the end of a report (unless after an abbreviation like "Dec.").
• If a report has sub-entries (marked by letters like (a), (b) or times like (1030), (1230)), keep them all on the same line.
• If a line fragment appears (not beginning with a name + colon), treat it as a continuation of a prior report. Merge it with the previous line if it's clearly part of that report.
• Always output exactly one report or one fragment per line.
• Never merge two complete reports into one line, and never split one report across lines.

Examples (reports):
Marcel Hullot (France): Radio Iberica (Madrid), indicated EAJ6.
Dol (Limerick): yes Prague.
Amplidyn (Purley): (a) surely Berlin, but why weak phones? (b) insufficient detail, cannot trace.
Chippy (Chichester): seeing reference to children's corner, at 9.20 p.m., presumably U.S.A. station.
Crane (Eaton): Hamburg.

How to handle fragments:
If you see a fragment like "(b) about 458m.) not traceable; (c) An amateur." on its own line, and the previous line ends with something like "Bennetts: (a) Petit Parisien 345m.;", merge them into: "Bennetts: (a) Petit Parisien 345m.; (b) about 458m.) not traceable; (c) An amateur."

Examples of fragments to be merged into preceding report include:
sub-entries like "(b) insufficient detail, cannot trace."
sub-entries like "(10.30) Hamburg; (11.30) Prague."
report text like "Hamburg."
hyphenated word segments from report-text like "berg."
reporter locations like "(Chichester): seeing reference..."
