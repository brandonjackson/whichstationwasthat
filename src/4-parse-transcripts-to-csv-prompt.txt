You are parsing 1920s DX listening reports into structured CSV.

Input format

Each line = one report.

A report has one or more reporters (before the colon) and one or more observations (after the colon).

Reporters: names/nicknames at start of line, with optional location in parentheses (e.g. T.T. (Bournemouth):).

Multiple reporters are comma-delimited.

Observations: after the colon, sometimes split into sub-entries marked by (a), (b) or times like (1030).

Observations describe a station (place, city, country, call sign, program type) or an editorial note (e.g. “too vague to trace”).

Output format

Output only valid CSV (no commentary, no markdown).

First row = exactly these 11 headers:
"reporter_name","reporter_location_city","reporter_location_country","reporter_location_latitude","reporter_location_longitude","observation_text","station_location_city","station_location_country","station_location_latitude","station_location_longitude","full_text"

Every subsequent row = exactly 11 fields.

Enclose all fields in double quotes.

Use "" for missing values.

Escape internal quotes by doubling them.

Parsing rules

One row = one reporter + one observation.

If a report has multiple reporters with the same observation → create one row per reporter, each with the same observation details.

If a report has multiple observations for one reporter → create one row per observation, with the reporter repeated.

Observation text: include only the portion relevant to that observation (keep markers like (a) or (1030) if present).

Full text: include the complete, unedited line from the input file (both reporter(s) and observation(s)).

Reporter location: extract from parentheses if given, else leave blank. 

For **reporter_location** and **station_location**:

- If a city is known, provide **latitude and longitude** for the city to **1 decimal place** (e.g., `48.9`, `2.4`).
- If only the country is known, use the **country centroid coordinates** (rounded to 1 decimal place).
- If location is ambiguous or unknown, use empty strings for both latitude and longitude.
- Do not guess. Only use locations you're reasonably confident in.
- Use a public relay’s **original broadcast location** when possible (e.g., if it says “relaying Hamburg,” use Hamburg).

Examples:

"reporter_name","reporter_location_city","reporter_location_country","reporter_location_latitude","reporter_location_longitude","observation_text","station_location_city","station_location_country","station_location_latitude","station_location_longitude","full_text"
"Crane","Eaton","UK","51.4","-0.1","Hamburg.","Hamburg","Germany","53.5","10.0","Crane (Eaton): Hamburg."
"Dol","Limerick","Ireland","52.7","-8.6","yes Prague.","Prague","Czech Republic","50.1","14.4","Dol (Limerick): yes Prague."

Final Thoughts
Don't forget: Output only valid CSV (no commentary, no markdown). Do not start with ```csv. Go straight to the csv header.
